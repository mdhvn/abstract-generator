Title:  The Magic Barrier Revisited: Accessing Natural Limitations of

====================
As a motivating example, we consider the task of rating prediction, along with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a widely used metric for prediction quality.

12.9544500032

====================
This leads to the assumption of some Magic Barrier where natural variability may prevent us from getting much more accurate [12].

12.8882445481

====================
Applied within a variety of engines, they predict human behaviour (e.g.

12.056476892

====================
Accordingly, this complicates the evaluation of recommender systems, since it is not clear whether the difference between a given rating and the prediction is induced by the system or just a matter of Human Uncertainty.

====================
ratings a user might give to a specific item) and thus models a user's preferences.

10.9244023884

====================
INTRODUCTION  Recommender systems have become quite essential for our modern information society.

10.8725196339

====================
This Human Uncertainty, as we understand it in this contribution, appears to be a characteristic feature of the cognitive process of decision making which influences its outcome, making it circumstantial and temporally unstable; the outcome appears to be more or less fluctuating randomly when repeating a decision making.

10.4643523482

====================
In this paper we use Monte-Carlo-Simulations as described in [18]: For each of our ratings X n , we compute a sample S(X n ) := {xn1 , .

10.2593783493

====================
If we are able to improve the systeminduced prediction quality to such an extent that only the factor of human uncertainty is left, then all visible differences within a quality metric would only exist due to this uncertainty and may vary with each repeated rating trial.

9.37436874735

====================
We also provide our data records for modelling Human Uncertainty and demonstrate its transferability using the example of Netflix Prize.

9.23517636044

====================
To this end we gradually fix a particular number N of ratings from the set {50, 100, 150, 200, 500, 1000} and sample N expectations un uniformly from the interval [1, 5] as well as N 2 ,s2 variances sn2 uniformly from [smin max ].

9.23042649227

====================
This implies that rankings of different (well improved) recommender systems would shuffle with each repetition as well, i.e sound rankings do no longer exist for excellent systems but there is an equivalence class of indistinguishable optimal systems.

9.08406570818

====================
Derived by risk function minimisation, the authors defined the Magic Barrier as the square root of the averaged user variances (gathered from repeated ratings).

8.96702347948

====================
Consequently, we may assume that observed decisions are drawn from individual distributions [10].

8.93033537797

====================
Figure 1a shows that only 35% of all users show constant rating behaviour, whereas about 50% use two different answer categories and 15% of all users make use of three or more categories.

8.74283349666

====================
(k ) O d (u)  as well as the variance V[(sn I + un - un )2 ] = V[(sn I)2 ]   V[sn2 I2 ] = sn4 V[I2 ] = sn4 E[I4 ] - E[I2 ]2   sn4 3V[I]2 - V[I]2 = 2sn4  I We thus obtain a kh 2 -distribution for Z := N1 n Yn which converges into a Gaussian for a large number N of ratings by means of the central limit theorem.

8.72684105916

====================
Although we exemplify our methodology in accordance with the RMSE, the main results of this contribution can be easily adopted for alternative assessment metrics without substantial loss of generality, insofar they require for (uncertain) human input.

8.69295883819

====================
The problem of Human Uncertainty - if not explicitly considered - is that any improvement to an existing system or even the assessment of different systems might not be statistically sound.

8.56718535063

====================
In doing so, we proceed as done in the regression analysis above, but instead of computing means and variances, we transform our samples into discrete probability distributions Psim and Papr and analyse the Jensen-ShannonDivergence (JSD) 1 1 JSD(Psim |Papr ) = D KL (Psim |M) + D KL (Papr |M) (20) 2 2 I where D KL (P1 |P2 ) = i P1 (i) log2 (P1 (i)/P2 (i)) denotes the KullbackLeibler-Divergence and M = 21 (Psim + Papr ).

As shown in the following sections, the standard deviation of the Magic Barrier for the Netflix data set can be assumed to be s = 0.0007, which is still seven times larger than the specified  arXiv, 2017, https://arxiv.org/  1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0  0  2000  4000  6000  Sample Size N  8000  0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00  10000  (a) E[M B] with respect to N  0  2000  4000  6000  Sample Size N  8000  10000  (b) V[M B] with respect to N  0.020  2.5  Variance of Magic Barrier  2.0  3.0 minimum maximum average  Mean of Magic Barrier  0.20 minimum maximum average  2.5  Variances of Magic Barrier  Mean of Magic Barrier  3.0  2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  Value for all Rating Variances  3.5  4.0  (c) V[M B] with respect to s 2  0.015 0.010  N=100 N=200 N=300 N=400 N=500 N=1000  0.005 0.000 0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  Value for all Rating Variances  3.5  4.0  (d) V[M B] with respect to s 2  Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis of the Magic Barrier varying the number of ratings and the extent of rating variances rounding accuracy of four decimal places.

====================
To derive a pragmatic and easy to handle theory, we will refer to the Gaussian Error Propagation which is commonly used in physics as well [6, 19, 25].

3.2  Composed Quantities  Composed quantities, in this contribution, are quantities Z that compute from a continuous function Z = d(X 1 , .

8.17911797482

====================
It has recently been shown, that users provide inconsistent ratings when requested to rate same films at different times [13].

8.10861755243

====================
To answer this question, we first compare the simulated expectations and variances with the calculated ones in a regression analysis.

8.04669595692

====================
To this end, we conducted a controlled experiment with real users and measured their uncertainty.

8.0160324481

====================
To this end, we assume the distribution of Human Uncertainty, emerged from our experiment, to be valid for a larger number of ratings.

7.93751659428

====================
When considering n arguments, we use a Taylor series in more dimensions and yield equivalent results which, together with the assumption of normality, form the Gaussian Error Propagation [6, 19, 25].

In consequence, measured properties are currently modelled by probability density functions and quantities calculated therefrom are then assigned a distribution by means of a convolution of their argument densities.

7.69548337014

====================
This, in particular, has financial implications when money is invested in the further development of a system but as a result, there is merely an overfitting instead of real improvements.

7.67551653588

====================
The ranking problem is most obvious for recommender R1 as it could be both, the best  arXiv, 2017, https://arxiv.org/ or the worst recommender, although it operates for the same users rating the same items.

7.67504943058

====================
3.1  Changing Paradigms  As mentioned above, various experiments [2, 13] along with our own have shown that users are scattering around their true value of preference.

7.63712257639

====================
When ranking these recommender systems, Figure 1b allows for three possible results (R1 [?]

7.58591628382

====================
Although the statistical simulation of convolutions produces excellent results while also being easy to realise, we are facing a blatant run-time problem as soon as we are entering the realm of big data.

7.58214550735

====================
We adopt the idea of modelling user uncertainty by means of individual Gaussians following the argumentation in [26] for constructing our individual response models.

7.56214680031

====================
In our contribution, we complete this theory and therefore allow a more differentiated analysis of recommender assessment.

7.53963178034

====================
Unfortunately, human beings can not be deemed as constant functions.

7.52553720484

====================
Motivating Example.

7.50031575973

====================
In this contribution, we present a method by which the Magic Barrier can be estimated for any quality assessment metric.

7.48385902408

====================
A comparison of Figure 3b and Figure 3d reveals that the number of ratings significantly affects the first two decimal places of the variance, whereas the influence of the rating uncertainty affects only the third and fourth decimal places at most.

7.46951194797

====================
For this purpose, we will embed the Magic Barrier into a complete probabilistic framework and deduce a pragmatic theory through complexity reduction.

7.45845469746

====================
5  EXPERIMENTS  In this section, we examine our theoretical considerations in reality.

7.4465306061

====================
(4) Post hoc illustration of this sample by a normed histogram with b bins leads to an approximation for the density of Z .

7.43971516717

====================
Therefrom, a paradigm shift has to be carried out, which is similar to the recent change of perspectives on measurement errors in metrology [8]: Every measurable quantity that is somehow related to human cognition is no longer considered as a single point (point-paradigm) but rather as a whole interval of possible values (set-paradigm) that is somehow distributed (distribution-paradigm).

7.39805820463

====================
These intervals result from the assumption of five repeated ratings (as happened in our experiments) with the commonly used 5-star scale.

7.39397843432

====================
3  MODELLING A MAGIC BARRIER  In this section, we embed human uncertainty into a mathematical construct and introduce an approach for estimating a Magic Barrier for a given evaluation metric.

7.38079718194

====================
In the context of this paper, we will, therefore, consider user ratings as random variables.

7.37140660249

====================
Therefore, our considerations above - the indistinguishability of excellent systems close to the Magic Barrier - hold even for straightforward investigations.

7.30992759689

====================
We received a rating tensor Ru,i,t with dim(R) = (67, 5, 5), having N = 1 675 ratings in total, where the coordinates (u, i, t) encode the rating that has been given to item i by user u in the t-th trial.

7.29704981115

====================
As a consequence, systems with an RMSE near the "old" Magic Barrier might already be interfered by this Human Uncertainty and respectively, achieving an RMSE less than the "old" Magic Barrier does not always mean that this system is already interfered.

7.25142948482

====================
With this, we get same results but need only a mere fraction of the simulation runtime.

7.22716957172

====================
The methodology applied in our experiments is adopted from experimental psychology [15] and works on repeating rating scenarios for same users-items-pairs as done before in [2].

7.21028008814

====================
Based on these observations, we compute the RMSE for three recommender systems (designed by definition of their predictors p ) for each rating trial.

====================
The Magic Barrier Revisited: Accessing Natural Limitations of Recommender Assessment Experimental Designs.

7.15530512435

====================
From this record we derive a unique rating distribution for each user-item-pair by considering tensor-slices in trial-dimension Ru,i := {Ru,i,t |t = 1, .

7.13025312969

====================
Even though this approach accounts for Human Uncertainty, its influence - namely the uncertainty of the Magic Barrier itself - remains unconsidered.

7.12547813097

====================
For the green curve (representing 10% noise of difference), an x-value of 0.15 means  2.5  9 approximated simulated  8 7  Probability Density  Probability Density  2.0  1.5  1.0  6 5 4 3 2  0.5  1 0.0 0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  Standard Deviation  Figure 5: Distribution of variances emerged from repeated ratings within our experiment  0 0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  RMSE Score  Figure 6: Visual comparison of simulated and approximation Magic Barrier based on experimental data records  arXiv, 2017, https://arxiv.org/ E[RMSEbest ] - E[MB] = 0.8567 - 0.6687 = 0.1880 is greater than 6V[MB]1/2 = 0.1587, it can be assumed that the Magic Barrier has not yet been reached.

7.08895833595

====================
We take this as a basis for our own modelling of uncertainty for addressing similar issues in the field of computer science.

7.05590424326

====================
Concerning the distribution model, we investigate the degree similarity using the Jensen-Shannon-Divergence.

7.04558586501

====================
We aim to generate concrete and action-oriented quantities that can easily be embedded in existing approaches to recommender assessment.

7.03018682662

====================
For the comparative assessment, different metrics are used to determine the prediction quality, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean average precision (MAP) along with many others [1, 7, 12].

7.01767028885

====================
This naturally implies to deem those RMSE scores as single draws from distributions that are strongly overlapping.

7.00066526158

====================
So there is a need for a decision criterion whether a system still has room for improvements.

6.99518648152

====================
In the case of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) q I RMSE = N1 n (X n - pn )2 , (2) the comparison of a rating X n and a prediction pn [?]

6.9909487529

====================
For the RMSE in particular, a criterion has recently been developed which allows for a dichotomous consideration (yes or no)[24].

6.93819282322

====================
On this basis, we develop statistical methodologies that are to be explored hereinafter.

6.9346546593

====================
However, the degree of this improvement decreases very rapidly.

6.93018325525

====================
It becomes apparent at once that the RMSE itself yields a particular degree of uncertainty, emerged from uncertain user feedback.

6.88171075795

====================
Since we use the base 2 logarithm, the JSD yields the boundaries 0 <= JSD <= 2 log(2) or  JSD 0 <= 2 log(2) <=1  (21)  The outcomes for the normed JSD is shown in Figure 2.

6.87962721098

====================
This might be totally different when considering the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), whose primary comparison is based on the function c(X n ) = |X n - pn |, reaching a minimum for its expectation when pn is the median of X n .

6.86782187266

====================
Figure 1b depicts the RMSE outcomes and their frequency.

6.82820506419

====================
Therefore, it would be useful to have a rule of thumb to find out whether a differentiated  10 Magic Barrier RMSE  Probability Density  8  6  4  2  0 0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  RMSE SCORE  consideration is fruitful or not.

6.7771775419

====================
5.1  The Experiment  Our experiment is set up with Unipark's5 survey engine while our participants were committed from the crowdsourcing platform Clickworker6 .

6.70800777135

====================
For this reason, metrologists typically apply statistical simulations.

6.70314353371

====================
This can be explained by the fact that the RMSE contains the sum of squared normal distributions, which is kh 2 -distributed, but quickly converges to the normal distribution 4 Samples  are only examples producing the minimum/maximum variance  Understanding the Magic Barrier  In this section, we will take a closer look at the properties of the Magic Barrier.

====================
", which allows for more differentiated evaluation of recommender systems.

6.69292477964

====================
Furthermore, we need a non-vanishing variance for a statistically sound decision whether a system can still be improved.

6.6928923368

====================
2  RELATED WORK  Recommender Systems and Assessment.

6.69217288227

====================
For this reason, an analysis of possible improvements can not be answered by a dichotomous decision criterion (yes or no), but has to be answered by means of probabilities (How likely is it that my system can still be improved and what risk am I willing to accept?).

6.69003435759

====================
Consequently, when assuming all X n ~ N (un , sn ) to be normally distributed (symmetric density function), the optimal recommender system does not differ for the RMSE and the MAE respectively.

6.67753440853

====================
To compute the Magic Barrier on the Netflix test record (N = 2.8 * 106 ), we need about 35 hours.

6.6758037831

====================
However, in our example (Fig 1b) we have seen that the RMSE (esp.

====================
Figure 4 illustrates the interference of the Magic Barrier with a recommender system used in our experiments.

6.62696595604

====================
In addition, we will generalise the dichotomous decision criterion from [24] and develop a pragmatic rule of thumb to ascertain whether a deeper consideration of the Magic Barrier seems worthwhile.

6.62519348288

====================
As will be revealed later, recommender R1 is the Magic Barrier itself.

6.61785139594

====================
Each of these copies is gradually distorted by adding artificial noise to their predictors in such a way that the relative noise difference of both copies remain constant.

6.57942053909

====================
Now having the definition of an optimal recommender system, we need to deduce the probability density function of the evaluation metric for this optimum.

6.57337558578

====================
One of the first works addressing Human Uncertainty and its impact on recommender systems was presented in [13], where users have been proven to give inconsistent ratings on movies.

6.57096998784

====================
This power-law distribution literally means, that many users have a low degree of uncertainty while only a few users have a very high degree of uncertainty.

6.54766612848

====================
Therefore, the crux is to recognise whether the prediction quality has really improved or is just some random artefact.

6.54531328437

====================
Finally, we have demonstrated the possibility to transfer our results onto other data records in order to make careful predictions of possible interference.

6.53763709316

====================
The central role of recommender systems led to a lot of research and produced a variety of techniques and approaches.

====================
Copyrights for third-party components of this work must be honored.

6.49603978926

====================
Consequently, we may assume that observed decisions are drawn from individual distributions, as a result of complex cognition processes, and influenced by multiple factors (e.g.

6.478862452

====================
This model is described in [17].

6.44369666413

====================
For this purpose, participants watched theatrical trailers of popular movies and television shows and provided ratings in five repetition trials7 .

====================
(R) into its Taylor series d(X ) =  [?]

6.41528567792

====================
For a visual comparison of both distributions, Figure 6 depicts the simulated density as well as the approximation for our experiment with N = 213.

6.37059534114

====================
But while the uncertainty of users is considered, its influence on the precise localisation of the Magic Barrier is negated.

6.36541618986

====================
In Figure 3a and 3b, one can observe the Magic Barrier's reaction to an increasing number N of ratings.

6.36362198174

====================
Then we have to compute the probability density function of the evaluation metric which arises for this optimal recommender.

6.35691208005

====================
A feasible framework for computing these convolutions via Monte-Carlo-Simulation is given by [18].

6.34329147724

====================
For each of the user-item-pairs Ru,i , we compute the Gaussian ML-Parameters and consider the variances V(Ru,i ) as representations of the Human Uncertainty.

6.32976662412

====================
The relevance of our contribution arises from the fact that the unavoidable human uncertainty sometimes has a vast influence on the evaluation of different prediction algorithms [3, 5].

6.32386729264

====================
We will demonstrate this by using an example.

6.31193823104

====================
In this example, we see that even for large data records the effort of considering the Magic Barrier as a distribution is quite meaningful.

6.29885642174

====================
This idea is widely used in cognitive science and in statistical modelling of ordinal data [14].

6.28989609587

====================
Having X n ~ G(an , bn ) being gamma-distributed instead, the optimal recommender may be different for both metrics, depending on the extent of asymmetry.

6.26060135542

====================
In theory, this is done by a convolution of all density functions fi of X i , but what sounds simple at first, turns out to be quite laborious and inapplicable as demonstrated in [9].

6.25490547955

====================
( n sn4 )/(2N n sn2 ) represents the traditionally neglected uncertainty of this Magic Barrier, emerged from uncertain user ratings.

6.25010713249

====================
Later, this upper bound was mentioned once again in [12] and received the name Magic Barrier, which is still in use nowadays.

====================
In this section we will derive closed form approximations for the RMSE and therefore define q I MB = d(X 1 , .

6.2333562336

====================
The complexity of human perception and cognition can be addressed by means of latent distributions [10].

6.21642461299

However, Figure 3b reveals that the Magic Barrier's variance is heavily impacted by the number of ratings, i.e.

6.19707112209

====================
The authors claim that it will never be possible to perfectly predict ratings and that there must exist an upper bound on rating prediction accuracy.

6.19132649136

====================
At this point, one may wonder how well this estimate actually matches the true state.

6.17560980227

Our Objective.

6.17445198226

====================
For example, for N = 80 000 ratings, the simulation already takes up to an hour of runtime1 .

====================
This naturally  The Magic Barrier Revisited: Accessing Natural Limitations of Recommender Assessment involves research that connects the fields of behavioural decision making, cognitive psychology and recommender systems to create interdisciplinary synergy effects.

6.17028917288

====================
We observe that the mid-range of all outcomes is located between 0.01 and 0.08 confirming high similarity of the simulated distribution and the assumed Gaussian.

R and arbitrary random variable X  (9)  Goodness of Approximation  As mentioned above, the method presented here is merely an approximation, since we omit terms of higher orders.

6.16598778799

====================
We have so far only considered a smooth function with just one argument in order to guarantee an easy understanding of the methodology.

6.16043188625

====================
Having several recommender systems whose RMSEs, for example, are lower than this Magic Barrier, every repetition of the rating proceeding would very likely result into rearrangements of the ranking order, i.e.

6.1590625579

====================
This reasoning can be understood heuristically: For each draw, there is a variety of possibilities for a single outcome x i of a random variable X i .

6.1435881843

====================
The idea of uncertainty is not only related to predictive data mining but also to measuring sciences such as metrology.

6.13736660718

====================
Although the term "Magic Barrier" is related to the RMSE in particular, such a barrier does basically exist for any metric comparing (uncertain) user inputs with predicted scores.

6.12195577313

====================
The Problem.

6.1167176106

====================
In summary, it can be said that the extent of Human Uncertainty alone is responsible for the location of the Magic Barrier, whilst its spread can be reduced by adding ratings.

6.11401911987

====================
User ratings have been recorded for five out of ten fixed trailers so that remaining trailers act as distractors triggering the misinformation effect, i.e.

6.10936376403

6.09246637171

====================
Therefore, we first develop a general framework which will then be illustrated for the RMSE as a prominent example.

6.07438252869

====================
By increasing the noise for both copies whilst keeping their relative difference constant, we generate an offset (distance from the Magic Barrier).

====================
, x n of all random variables altogether result into a single outcome for the composed quantity Z by means of z = d(x 1 , .

6.0558962607

====================
In addition, it may be possible that further repetitions of ratings would lead to even more ranking possibilities.

6.05339890729

====================
In our experiment, the existence of Human Uncertainty is proven and it has been shown that it corresponds to a power-law distribution, i.e.

====================

6.03334764063

====================
Recently, a paradigm shift was initiated on the basis of a so far incomplete theory of error [8, 11].

6.03007186903

====================
In doing so, we choose Gaussians as the underlying data model for our ratings.

6.02832863263

====================
For many repetitions, we receive a lot of simulated expectations/variances to be plotted against the approximated ones by means of linear regression.

5.99965779693

This convergence is actually the true nature of the Magic Barrier, which could not have been shown without switching perspectives to the distribution-paradigm.

====================
Dealing with Uncertainties.

5.95596886568

====================
5.3  The Magic Barrier  Figure 3a shows that the expected value of the Magic Barrier depends solely on the Human Uncertainty.

5.955738513

====================
For our five-star scale as well as its minimum and maximum variances, the expectation should - when equation 15 holds - be located in the interval [0.40 ; 1.55].

5.95063080418

====================
Therefore, we must first specify an optimal recommender by defining its predictors.

5.94633823768

====================
In the following sections, we will derive a pragmatic estimate for the desired density function of the Magic Barrier for arbitrary metrics.

5.94484817019

====================
The choice of predictors depends on the evaluation metric and the underlying data model.

For the variance and its quasi-linearity3 , we yield # !2 [?]

5.92945977

====================
(8)  4.2  Since we have to face multiple arguments, we would usually need a Taylor series in several variables, which is quite ugly for demonstration purposes.

5.92485943071

====================
Thus, the more ratings we have, the more adequate is a Gaussian as the assumed density.

5.91209392964

====================
For this purpose, the individual dependencies of the Magic Barrier and their effects are analysed in a sensitivity analysis.

5.90972176424

====================
Performing an item-wise analysis, the fraction of tensor slices with non-zero variance ranges from 50 to 90% that is, only every second participant is able to reproduce its own decisions for the best case.

5.88324300677

====================
The usual approximation is to omit terms of higher orders, like E[d(X )]  =  d(u) + d 0 (u) * m 1 + .

5.87297321351

====================
Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the degree of deviation of both distributions.

5.87184962356

====================
Then, we yield a sample for the evaluation metric Z = d(X 1 , .

5.86729976821

====================
Applying the one-dimensional Taylor approximation from equations 6 and 7 leads to  k =0  where the last line has been simplified by using the common identity V[(X - u)k ] = E[(X - u)2k ] - E[(X - u)k ]2 = m 2k -mk 2 .

For example, financial resources may be invested in improving a system but the improvements achieved are purely random, which remains unnoticed.

====================
First of all, the world of recommender assessment does not entirely consist of large-scale experiments, so that the variance can not be deemed to equal zero.

====================
Only the extent of the uncertainty raises or lowers the mean value.

5.79992472522

Hence, the optimal recommender system with respect to the RMSE is defined by pn := E[X n ] for each user-item-pair n .

On a 5-star scale together with five re-ratings, the expected value yields limitations (green and red) due to the minimum and maximum variance possible.

====================
The essence of our contribution is the revelation of the following problems: (1) People are not able to tell us what they really mean.

5.66549487163

====================
It is seen that the expectation remains unaffected by the number of uncertain ratings.

====================
Under this condition, we will examine possible consequences on Netflix Prize as an example.

5.6432405918

====================
Altogether 67 people from Germany, Austria and Switzerland participated in this experiment.

5.64184699153

====================
This basically means that a recommender system within a repeated process of improvement will certainly reach a prediction quality so that there is probably no sufficiently large amount of optimisation left, in order to distinguish further improvements from the old system with statistical evidence.

There are, however, some outliers which only occur for N = 50 ratings.

Therefore, we vary one argument within reasonable boundaries while fixing all the other arguments at the same time.

This offset is plotted against the probabilities of error when using the traditional point-paradigm ranking, which is given by the generalisation of equation 22.

Following [24], any improvement of a recommender system is pointless, if the RMSE score is below the Magic Barrier, i.e.

====================
With our probabilistic approach, the true nature of the Magic Barrier can be demonstrated: When approaching the Magic Barrier, the distinguishability of many recommender systems automatically decreases, supporting the idea of one equivalence class of optimal systems.

5.16879361628

====================
It is clear from Figure 3b  arXiv, 2017, https://arxiv.org/  that for this sample size, the distribution of the Human Uncertainty has a large impact on the variance of the Magic Barrier.

5.15810745806

====================
To estimate whether the contest winner [21] might interfere with the Magic Barrier, we use the simplification of Equation 23.
