Abstract: This paper presents new properties of Primitive Pythagorean Triples (PPT) that have
relevance in applications where events of different probability need to be generated and in
cryptography.

Introduction
The generation of events of specific probability is of importance in cryptography and in
applications such as e-commerce [1],[2]. Such events may be generated by a variety of methods
that include prime reciprocals [3],[4],[5], or by the use of specific modular operations [6]. The
generation of random events is also tied up with the question of algorithmic probability [7]. Here
we consider Pythagorean triples to generate probability events.
The lengths of sides of a right angled triangle represent a Pythagorean triple. A Pythagorean
triple (a, b, c) should satisfy the condition
as said in the pythogorous theorem
which acts as the basis for trigonometry. We can generate infinity number of Pythagorean triples
i.e. x (a, b, c) where x>1. A primitive Pythagorean triple is the one in which neither of the three
numbers have any common factor. We can write a, b, c as

b=
c=
Where s, t are odd and co-primes to each other and
For example for the triple (3, 4, 5) s=3 and t=1.

and also

.

The Pythagorean triples a, b, c are divisible by either 3 or 4 or 5 separately or jointly so as the
primitive Pythagorean triples. This property is used and divided all the PPTs into six classes by
Kak [8], who also presents their historical background. If we could index sequences of these
classes in different ways, this will have cryptographic applications. In this paper, the number of
occurrences of transitions amongst pairs of classes in the first 10,000 PPTs is presented.

Background
Euclidean Pythagorean primitive triples [9], [10] may be obtained using the formula

2
Where m, n are relatively prime to each other and only of them is even and the other is odd.
We need to have pair of positive integers in which one of them is odd and the other is even and
also relatively prime to each other in order to generate a PPT. We can do that by taking an odd
number and writing it as sum of two numbers. If this pair of numbers happens to be relatively
prime to each other, we can use them to generate a primitive Pythagorean triple. Once we get the
PPT our next task is to find to which class they belong. Depending upon the divisibility of PPT
(a, b, c) by 3 and 5 they have been classified into six different classes [8]:
1. Class A in which a is divisible by 3 and c divisible by 5

These are arranged in increasing order of hypotenuse length (c). If the hypotenuse lengths are
equal then they placed according to the increasing order of ‘a’. The corresponding sequence of
classes for the above 34 PPTs is ABCDEBECFAABDDEBEFCACDDEBFCFAABCDD. This
sequence does not include all possible pair wise transitions. To obtain all pair wise transitions we
need to go to 8182 PPTs. If we take w(x)'s continuously 2, 3, 4 or 5 at a time there will be
repetitions after first 26 PPTs. If we take i=6 then
will be
28 unique combinations. The graph of this behavior is given below.

Property 1.
For any prime number y, n number of co prime pairs are possible whose sum is the prime
number itself through which we can generate n number of PPTs where
.
Proof: Since every number has n pairs of numbers whose is number itself. So, we need to show
that for any prime number all the n pairs are co primes
Let y be a prime number and let
. Let’s say that r, s are not co-primes and none of
them are zero. Therefore there exists a number, let’s say z, which divides both the numbers(r, s)
and z< y since r, s are less than y. Since z divides both the r, s, it must also divide y which is a
contradiction, since y is a prime number. Therefore we can say that all the pairs (r, s) for a prime

Property 2
For all the odd multiples of 15, the PPTs generated will belong to class C.
Property 3
All the prime numbers which end with 3 or 7, except for 3, will follow a cyclic sequence

Property 4
All the prime numbers which end with 1 or 5, except for 5, will follow a cyclic sequence

By observing two consecutive PPTs and drawing a table, we get the results of Table 2.

Table 2 summarizes several properties for first 10,000 PPTs. Here X gives you the number of
occurrences and y gives you the first occurrence. The sequence of PPTs will change when
arranged by different conditions.
The table shows how the transition probabilities are different and will change with different
indexing schemes. This will allow for different probability events to be generated.

Indexing of PPTs
PPTs may be indexed in a variety of ways. The most obvious ones are listed below, where we
also list the total length of the sequence in which all transitions between the six classes occur.
1. Arranged in increasing order of a in (a, b, c). All transitions occur in sequence length of
300. The sequence begins as: ABDEFDCCDFEABECEBAABDBFBECAFDDACDC.
2. Arranged in increasing order of b in (a, b, c). All transitions occur in sequence length of
4037. The sequence begins as: ACBBAEEDDCCDEABCAFFBEDDCACFBEDDBAF.
3. Arranged in increasing order of c-b in (a, b, c). All transitions occur in sequence length
of 132. The sequence begins as: ABDEFDCDFCEAEEABCBBBBADFCFDEAADCDC.

4. Arranged in increasing order of c-a in (a, b, c). All transitions occur in sequence length of
504. The sequence begins as: ACBAEDCBECDACDBFDEABCAFEFDBDCEBDAF.
5. Arranged in increasing order of b-a in (a, b, c). All transitions occur in sequence length
of 147. The sequence begins as: CDCDEAAADFBCCCBEAFBBDADEEBFDBECADF.
Other indexing schemes may be used by placing conditions on the three parameters or by
imposing uniform or nonuniform decimation of the specific PPT sequence.
If only the sender and the recipient are in the know regarding the indexing scheme used, then the
corresponding PPT term would be the key that the two parties would have successfully
exchanged.

Conclusion
This paper presents some new results on the sequence of PPTs (a, b, c) related to their six classes
w(x). It shows how different sequences are obtained using different indexing schemes. The PPT
sequence which is arranged in increasing order of
covers all possibilities, when pairs of
classes are considered, in fewer steps compared to other basic PPT sequences.
