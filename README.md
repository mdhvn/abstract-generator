## Introduction

< some intro about how loads of technical papers are written every day and how the abstract is a key part of the paper, since it is meant to succinctly summarize the paper for the reader's convenience, and the abstract often comes in useful as a quick way to tell whether or not a paper is relevant to something someone may be searching for >

Hence, we decided to create a tool that takes a technical paper of any kind, and auto-generates an abstract < some details about the kind of abstract we will generate > using < some methods >.

## Method and Tools

## Other Ideas

on our corpus and eliminating “stop” words (“and”, “or”, “not” etc.) (sources from nltk) to find the most important words in a paper. We could then further eliminate words by checking which ones do/don’t occur in the abstract for the paper. This would give us a list of “keywords”, which are the basic building blocks of a paper, and in themselves a way to “identify” the contents of the paper.

- Something that takes in a text and modifies it so that its meaning remains the same but a plagiarism detector would be unable to tell that it has been copied
- Something that takes in a multilingual text and tags each individual language substring of the text
- Classifying Movie Scripts (Genre)
- Classifying Books (Genre)
- Classifying article as written by Republican/Democrat
