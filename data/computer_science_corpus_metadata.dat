VMorphological Analysis of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Language using Finite\u000a  State Transducers
p6
sS'summary'
p7
VIn this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri\u000alanguage, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now,\u000athere is no computational work available for the language. Finite state\u000amorphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of\u000alanguages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to\u000aanalyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.

p23
VThe aim of this paper is to bring together the notions of quantum game and\u000agame isomorphism. The work is intended as an attempt to introduce a new\u000acriterion for quantum game schemes. The generally accepted requirement forces a\u000aquantum scheme to generate the classical game in a particular case. Now, given\u000aa quantum game scheme and two isomorphic classical games, we additionally\u000arequire the resulting quantum games to be isomorphic as well. We are concerned\u000awith the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantum game scheme and the strong\u000aisomorphism between games in strategic form.

VNetwork Function Virtualization (NFV) refers to the use of commodity hardware\u000aresources as the basic platform to perform specialized network functions as\u000aopposed to specialized hardware devices. Currently, NFV is mainly implemented\u000abased on general purpose processors, or general purpose network processors. In\u000athis paper we propose the use of FPGAs as an ideal platform for NFV that can be\u000aused to provide both the flexibility of virtualizations and the high\u000aperformance of the specialized hardware. We present the early attempts of using\u000aFPGAs dynamic reconfiguration in network processing applications to provide\u000aflexible network functions and we present the opportunities for an FPGA-based\u000aNFV platform.

VAutomatic Performance Debugging of SPMD Parallel Programs
p94
sS'summary'
p95
VAutomatic performance debugging of parallel applications usually involves two\u000asteps: automatic detection of performance bottlenecks and uncovering their root\u000acauses for performance optimization. Previous work fails to resolve this\u000achallenging issue in several ways: first, several previous efforts automate\u000aanalysis processes, but present the results in a confined way that only\u000aidentifies performance problems with apriori knowledge; second, several tools\u000atake exploratory or confirmatory data analysis to automatically discover\u000arelevant performance data relationships. However, these efforts do not focus on\u000alocating performance bottlenecks or uncovering their root causes. In this\u000apaper, we design and implement an innovative system, AutoAnalyzer, to\u000aautomatically debug the performance problems of single program multi-data\u000a(SPMD) parallel programs. Our system is unique in terms of two dimensions:\u000afirst, without any apriori knowledge, we automatically locate bottlenecks and\u000auncover their root causes for performance optimization; second, our method is\u000alightweight in terms of size of collected and analyzed performance data. Our\u000acontribution is three-fold. First, we propose a set of simple performance\u000ametrics to represent behavior of different processes of parallel programs, and\u000apresent two effective clustering and searching algorithms to locate\u000abottlenecks. Second, we propose to use the rough set algorithm to automatically\u000auncover the root causes of bottlenecks. Third, we design and implement the\u000aAutoAnalyzer system, and use two production applications to verify the\u000aeffectiveness and correctness of our methods. According to the analysis results\u000aof AutoAnalyzer, we optimize two parallel programs with performance\u000aimprovements by minimally 20% and maximally 170%.

VInfluence systems form a large class of multiagent systems designed to model\u000ahow influence, broadly defined, spreads across a dynamic network.

Besides resolving the dynamics of a popular family of\u000amultiagent systems, the other contribution of this work is to introduce a new\u000atype of renormalization-based bifurcation analysis for multiagent systems.

A taxonomy\u000ais presented for performance assurance through three key stages of a product\u000alife cycle-high level performance, RTL performance, and silicon performance.\u000aThe proposed taxonomy includes two components-independent performance assurance\u000aspace for each stage and a correlation performance assurance space between\u000astages. It provides a detailed insight into the performance assurance space in\u000aterms of coverage provided taking into account capabilities and limitations of\u000atools and methodologies used at each stage. An application of the taxonomy to\u000acases described in the literature and to high performance Intel architectures\u000ais shown. The proposed work should be of interest to manufacturers of high\u000aperformance microprocessor/chipset architectures and has not been discussed in\u000athe literature.

VCurrent security model in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\u000apredominantly use symmetric key cryptography. The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\u000asymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\u000aadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VSystematic literature studies have received much attention in empirical\u000asoftware engineering in recent years. They have become a powerful tool to\u000acollect and structure reported knowledge in a systematic and reproducible way.\u000aWe distinguish systematic literature reviews to systematically analyze reported\u000aevidence in depth, and systematic mapping studies to structure a field of\u000ainterest in a broader, usually quantified manner. Due to the rapidly increasing\u000abody of knowledge in software engineering, researchers who want to capture the\u000apublished work in a domain often face an extensive amount of publications,\u000awhich need to be screened, rated for relevance, classified, and eventually\u000aanalyzed. Although there are several guidelines to conduct literature studies,\u000athey do not yet help researchers coping with the specific difficulties\u000aencountered in the practical application of these guidelines. In this article,\u000awe present an experience-based guideline to aid researchers in designing\u000asystematic literature studies with special emphasis on the data collection and\u000aselection procedures. Our guideline aims at providing a blueprint for a\u000apractical and pragmatic path through the plethora of currently available\u000apractices and deliverables capturing the dependencies among the single steps.\u000aThe guideline emerges from various mapping studies and literature reviews\u000aconducted by the authors and provides recommendations for the general study\u000adesign, data collection, and study selection procedures. Finally, we share our\u000aexperiences and lessons learned in applying the different practices of the\u000aproposed guideline.

Sensory feedback allows\u000aminimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the\u000arobot paths during robot operation.\u000a  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from\u000aa common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or\u000aCAD model accuracy.\u000a  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has\u000ato do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular\u000atechnological applications.\u000a  Practical implications - Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages\u000ain their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to\u000aprogram robots without the need for skilled robot programmers.\u000a  Originality/value - The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming\u000asystem. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing running on a\u000acommonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a\u000acommercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD\u000aintegrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no\u000aadvanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot\u000aprograms are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot\u000alanguage.

VWe investigate the relationship between mapping cones and matrix ordered\u000a*-vector spaces (i.e., abstract operator systems). We show that to every\u000amapping cone there is an associated operator system on the space of n-by-n\u000acomplex matrices, and furthermore we show that the associated operator system\u000ais unique and has a certain homogeneity property. Conversely, we show that the\u000acone of completely positive maps on any operator system with that homogeneity\u000aproperty is a mapping cone. We also consider several related problems, such as\u000acharacterizing cones that are closed under composition on the right by\u000acompletely positive maps, and cones that are also semigroups, in terms of\u000aoperator systems.

p264
sS'summary'
p265
VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

VImpact of robot responsiveness and adult involvement on children's\u000a  social behaviours in human-robot interaction
p275
sg152
VA key challenge in developing engaging social robots is creating convincing,\u000aautonomous and responsive agents, which users perceive, and treat, as social\u000abeings. As a part of the collaborative project: Expressive Agents for Symbiotic\u000aEducation and Learning (EASEL), this study examines the impact of autonomous\u000aresponse to children's speech, by the humanoid robot Zeno, on their\u000ainteractions with it as a social entity. Results indicate that robot autonomy\u000aand adult assistance during HRI can substantially influence children's\u000abehaviour during interaction and their affect after. Children working with a\u000afully-autonomous, responsive robot demonstrated greater physical activity\u000afollowing robot instruction than those working with a less responsive robot,\u000awhich required adult assistance to interact with. During dialogue with the\u000arobot, children working with the fully-autonomous robot also looked towards the\u000arobot in anticipation of its vocalisations on more occasions. In contrast, a\u000aless responsive robot, requiring adult assistance to interact with, led to\u000agreater self-report positive affect and more occasions of children looking to\u000athe robot in response to its vocalisations. We discuss the broader implications\u000aof these findings in terms of anthropomorphism of social robots and in relation\u000ato the overall project strategy to further the understanding of how\u000ainteractions with social robots could lead to task-appropriate symbiotic\u000arelationships.

VEmail Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user\u000aretrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query. Up to our knowledge,\u000aexisting email retrieval ranking approaches sort the retrieved emails based on\u000asome heuristic rules, which are either search clues or some predefined user\u000acriteria rooted in email fields. Unfortunately, the user usually does not know\u000athe effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper\u000apresents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It\u000aranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial\u000aemail fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an\u000aarchitecture to allow every user in a network/group of users to be able, if\u000apermissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in\u000ahis submitted query words. The experimental evaluation on Enron corpus prove\u000athat our approach outperforms known email retrieval ranking approaches.

VApproximate Data Structures with Applications
p308

VThis paper explores the notion of approximate data structures, which return\u000aapproximately correct answers to queries, but run faster than their exact\u000acounterparts. The paper describes approximate variants of the van Emde Boas\u000adata structure, which support the same dynamic operations as the standard van\u000aEmde Boas data structure (min, max, successor, predecessor, and existence\u000aqueries, as well as insertion and deletion), except that answers to queries are\u000aapproximate. The variants support all operations in constant time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polylog(n), and in O(loglogn) time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polynomial(n), for n elements in the data\u000astructure.\u000a  Applications described include Prim's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm,\u000aDijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm, and an on-line variant of\u000aGraham's convex hull algorithm. To obtain output which approximates the desired\u000aoutput with the performance guarantee tending to 1, Prim's algorithm requires\u000aonly linear time, Dijkstra's algorithm requires O(mloglogn) time, and the\u000aon-line variant of Graham's algorithm requires constant amortized time per\u000aoperation.

VThe idea of functional programming has played a big role in shaping today's\u000alandscape of mainstream programming languages.

This paper proposes how the same can be achieved for structured\u000aprogramming and PURELY functional programming via the notion of LINEAR SCOPE.\u000aOne advantage of this proposal is that mainstream programmers can reap the\u000abenefits of purely functional programming like easily exploitable parallelism\u000awhile using familiar structured programming syntax and without knowing concepts\u000alike monads. A second advantage is that professional purely functional\u000aprogrammers can often avoid hard to read functional code by using structured\u000aprogramming syntax that is often easier to parse mentally.

VMultidimensional Visualization of Oracle Performance Using Barry007
p415
sg95
VMost generic performance tools display only system-level performance data\u000ausing 2-dimensional plots or diagrams and this limits the informational detail\u000athat can be displayed. Moreover, a modern relational database system, like\u000aOracle, can concurrently serve thousands of client processes with different\u000aworkload characteristics, so that generic performance-data displays inevitably\u000ahide important information. Drawing on our previous work, this paper\u000ademonstrates the application of Barry007 multidimensional visualization to the\u000aanalysis of Oracle end-user, session-level, performance data, showing both\u000acollective trends and individual performance anomalies.

VInformation is the basic concept of information theory. However, there is no\u000adefinition of this concept that can encompass all uses of the term information\u000ain information theories and beyond. Many question a possibility of such a\u000adefinition. However, foundations of information theory developed in the context\u000aof the general theory of information made it possible to build such a relevant\u000aand at the same time, encompassing definition. Foundations of information\u000atheory are built in a form of ontological principles, which reflect basic\u000afeatures of information and information processes.

VRecently, a review concluded that Google Scholar (GS) is not a suitable\u000asource of information "for identifying recent conference papers or other gray\u000aliterature publications". The goal of this letter is to demonstrate that GS can\u000abe an effective tool to search and find gray literature, as long as appropriate\u000asearch strategies are used. To do this, we took as examples the same two case\u000astudies used by the original review, describing first how GS processes\u000aoriginal's search strategies, then proposing alternative search strategies, and\u000afinally generalizing each case study to compose a general search procedure\u000aaimed at finding gray literature in Google Scholar for two wide selected case\u000astudies: a) all contributions belonging to a congress (the ASCO Annual\u000aMeeting); and b) indexed guidelines as well as gray literature within medical\u000ainstitutions (National Institutes of Health) and governmental agencies (U.S.\u000aDepartment of Health & Human Services). The results confirm that original\u000asearch strategies were undertrained offering misleading results and erroneous\u000aconclusions. Google Scholar lacks many of the advanced search features\u000aavailable in other bibliographic databases (such as Pubmed), however, it is one\u000athing to have a friendly search experience, and quite another to find gray\u000aliterature. We finally conclude that Google Scholar is a powerful tool for\u000asearching gray literature, as long as the users are familiar with all the\u000apossibilities it offers as a search engine. Poorly formulated searches will\u000aundoubtedly return misleading results.

VOn numerically hypercyclic operators
p438
sg365
VAccording to Kim, Peris and Song, a continuous linear operator $T$ on a\u000acomplex Banach space $X$ is called {\u005cit numerically hypercyclic} if the\u000anumerical orbit $\u005c{f(T^nx):n\u005cin\u005cN\u005c}$ is dense in $\u005cC$ for some $x\u005cin X$ and\u000a$f\u005cin X^*$ satisfying $\u005c|x\u005c|=\u005c|f\u005c|=f(x)=1$. They have characterized numerically\u000ahypercyclic weighted shifts and provided an example of a numerically\u000ahypercyclic operator on $\u005cC^2$.\u000a  We answer two questions of Kim, Peris and Song. Namely, we construct a\u000anumerically hypercyclic operator, whose square is not numerically hypercyclic\u000aas well as an operator which is not numerically hypercyclic but has two\u000anumerical orbits whose union is dense in $\u005cC$. We characterize numerically\u000ahypercyclic operators on $\u005cC^2$ as well as the operators similar to a\u000anumerically hypercyclic one and those operators whose conjugacy class consists\u000aentirely of numerically hypercyclic operators. We describe in spectral terms\u000athe operator norm closure of the set of numerically hypercyclic operators on a\u000areflexive Banach space. Finally, we provide criteria for numeric hypercyclicity\u000aand decide upon the numerical hypercyclicity of operators from various classes.

VSoftware model refactoring based on performance analysis: better working\u000a  on software or performance side?
p461

VSeveral approaches have been introduced in the last few years to tackle the\u000aproblem of interpreting model-based performance analysis results and\u000atranslating them into architectural feedback. Typically the interpretation can\u000atake place by browsing either the software model or the performance model. In\u000athis paper, we compare two approaches that we have recently introduced for this\u000agoal: one based on the detection and solution of performance antipatterns, and\u000aanother one based on bidirectional model transformations between software and\u000aperformance models. We apply both approaches to the same example in order to\u000aillustrate the differences in the obtained performance results. Thereafter, we\u000araise the level of abstraction and we discuss the pros and cons of working on\u000athe software side and on the performance side.

VEffective emergency and natural disaster management depend on the efficient\u000amission-critical voice and data communication between first responders and\u000avictims. Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband technology used\u000afor critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.\u000aRecently Long Term Evolution (LTE) emerged as a broadband communication\u000atechnology that has a potential to transform the capabilities of public safety\u000atechnologies by providing broadband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical voice and\u000adata support. For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a\u000anationwide coast-to-coast public safety network based of LTE broadband\u000atechnology. This paper presents a comparative survey of legacy and the\u000aLTE-based public safety networks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE convergence as\u000awell as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A simulation study of LMRS and\u000aLTE band class 14 technologies is provided using the NS-3 open source tool. An\u000aexperimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class 14 is also conducted using\u000asoftware-defined radio, to enhance the understanding of the public safety\u000asystems. Finally, emerging technologies that may have strong potential for use\u000ain public safety networks are reviewed.

VComparing Fifty Natural Languages and Twelve Genetic Languages Using\u000a  Word Embedding Language Divergence (WELD) as a Quantitative Measure of\u000a  Language Distance
p486

VWe introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word\u000aembedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as\u000adivergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.\u000aUsing such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural\u000alanguages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a\u000acollection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for\u000afifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VThe Dissecting Power of Regular Languages
p491
sg7
VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VProactive bottleneck performance analysis in parallel computing using\u000a  openMP
p516
sg95
VThe aim of parallel computing is to increase an application performance by\u000aexecuting the application on multiple processors. OpenMP is an API that\u000asupports multi platform shared memory programming model and shared-memory\u000aprograms are typically executed by multiple threads. The use of multi threading\u000acan enhance the performance of application but its excessive use can degrade\u000athe performance. This paper describes a novel approach to avoid bottlenecks in\u000aapplication and provide some techniques to improve performance in OpenMP\u000aapplication. This paper analyzes bottleneck performance as bottleneck inhibits\u000aperformance. Performance of multi threaded applications is limited by a variety\u000aof bottlenecks, e.g. critical sections, barriers and so on. This paper provides\u000asome tips how to avoid performance bottleneck problems. This paper focuses on\u000ahow to reduce overheads and overall execution time to get better performance of\u000aapplication.

Some connections between the potential equations and the\u000aexisting characterizations of potential games are established. It is revealed\u000athat a finite game is potential if and only if its every bi-matrix sub-game is\u000apotential.

It teaches students proper software\u000aengineering -- in particular, modularity and documentation -- by having them\u000aimplement four core robotics algorithms for an educational robot. To evaluate\u000athe effect of software engineering education in robotics context, we analyze\u000apre- and post-class survey data and the four assignments our students completed\u000afor the course.

VStrategic Decompositions of Normal Form Games: Zero-sum Games and\u000a  Potential Games
p601
sg23
VWe study new classes of games, called zero-sum equivalent games and zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these\u000aclasses of games. We say that two games are "strategically equivalent" if, for\u000aevery player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other\u000aplayers' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game\u000athat is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent\u000apotential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent\u000ato a common interest game. We also call a game "normalized" if the sum of one\u000aplayer's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show\u000athat any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common\u000ainterest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we\u000ashow that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets\u000agenerically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a\u000astrictly dominant Nash equilibrium.

VFormation of General Position by Asynchronous Mobile Robots
p606
sg152
VThe traditional distributed model of autonomous, homogeneous, mobile point\u000arobots usually assumes that the robots do not create any visual obstruction for\u000athe other robots, i.e., the robots are see through. In this paper, we consider\u000aa slightly more realistic model, by incorporating the notion of obstructed\u000avisibility (i.e., robots are not see through) for other robots. Under the new\u000amodel of visibility, a robot may not have the full view of its surroundings.\u000aMany of the existing algorithms demand that each robot should have the complete\u000aknowledge of the positions of other robots. Since, vision is the only mean of\u000atheir communication, it is required that the robots are in general position\u000a(i.e., no three robots are collinear). We consider asynchronous robots. They\u000aalso do not have common chirality (or any agreement on a global coordinate\u000asystem). In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for obtaining a\u000ageneral position for the robots in finite time from any arbitrary\u000aconfiguration. The algorithm also assures collision free motion for each robot.\u000aThis algorithm may also be used as a preprocessing module for many other\u000asubsequent tasks performed by the robots.

VIn the last decades, great achievements have been made in the development of\u000acomputing machines. However, due to exponential growth of transistor density\u000aand in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers\u000aexpect that "Conventional Technologies" like Complementary Metal-Oxide\u000aSemiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the\u000aneeds for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are\u000aneeded. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of\u000aconventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising\u000asolution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high\u000aspeed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the\u000ainput data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new\u000atechnology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the\u000aacceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side\u000atransformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge\u000ato designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible\u000acircuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track.\u000aIn this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on binary logic system\u000ahas been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in binary logic\u000asystem and output as reversible circuit. Entire environment is GUI based and\u000aeasy to learn user friendly. This tool offers editing, storage and conversion\u000ainto reversible facility.

VWhile every network node only relays messages in a traditional communication\u000asystem, the recent network coding (NC) paradigm proposes to implement simple\u000ain-network processing with packet combinations in the nodes. NC extends the\u000aconcept of "encoding" a message beyond source coding (for compression) and\u000achannel coding (for protection against errors and losses). It has been shown to\u000aincrease network throughput compared to traditional networks implementation, to\u000areduce delay and to provide robustness to transmission errors and network\u000adynamics. These features are so appealing for multimedia applications that they\u000ahave spurred a large research effort towards the development of\u000amultimedia-specific NC techniques. This paper reviews the recent work in NC for\u000amultimedia applications and focuses on the techniques that fill the gap between\u000aNC theory and practical applications. It outlines the benefits of NC and\u000apresents the open challenges in this area. The paper initially focuses on\u000amultimedia-specific aspects of network coding, in particular delay, in-network\u000aerror control, and media-specific error control. These aspects permit to handle\u000avarying network conditions as well as client heterogeneity, which are critical\u000ato the design and deployment of multimedia systems. After introducing these\u000ageneral concepts, the paper reviews in detail two applications that lend\u000athemselves naturally to NC via the cooperation and broadcast models, namely\u000apeer-to-peer multimedia streaming and wireless networking.

VLinear Software Models is a systematic effort to formulate a theory of\u000asoftware systems neatly based upon standard mathematics, viz. linear algebra.\u000aIt has appeared in a series of papers dealing with various aspects of the\u000atheory. But one was lacking a single source for its key ideas. This paper\u000aconcisely distills foundational ideas and results obtained within Linear\u000aSoftware Models. First and foremost we claim that one must have a deep\u000acomprehension of the theory of software - the aim of this effort - before\u000aembarking into theory and practice of software engineering. The Modularity\u000aMatrix is the central algebraic structure of the software theory: it is the\u000asource of quantitative modularity criteria; it displays high cohesion, i.e.\u000ahigh sparsity; a Standard Modularity Matrix is defined - square and\u000ablock-diagonal - enabling designs comparison for any software systems in a\u000aSoftware Design Laboratory. It triggers formulation of novel open questions\u000awaiting for resolution.

As a consequence they can be effectively computed in\u000aparallel exploiting commodity hardware, hence without particularly\u000asophisticated interconnection networks. Basically, this means Clusters,\u000aNetworks of Workstations and Desktops as well as Computational Clouds. Despite\u000athe simplicity of this computational model, it can be exploited to compute a\u000aquite large range of problems. This paper describes JJPF, a tool for developing\u000atask parallel applications based on Java and Jini that showed to be an\u000aeffective and efficient solution in environment like Clusters and Networks of\u000aWorkstations and Desktops.

VIn the first of this pair of papers, it was proven that that no physical\u000acomputer can correctly carry out all computational tasks that can be posed to\u000ait. The generality of this result follows from its use of a novel definition of\u000acomputation, ``physical computation''. This second paper of the pair elaborates\u000athe mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical\u000acomputation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing\u000aMachines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the\u000a(im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an\u000aanalogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is\u000aelaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction\u000acomplexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal\u000aphysical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding''\u000abound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing\u000amachine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it\u000ais proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type\u000aof computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic\u000ainformation complexity).

p714
sg365
VWe show that the celebrated 1956 Lax-Richtmyer linear theorem in Numerical\u000aAnalysis - often called the Fundamental Theorem of Numerical Analysis - is in\u000afact wrong. Here "wrong" does not mean that its statement is false\u000amathematically, but that it has a limited practical relevance as it\u000amisrepresents what actually goes on in the numerical analysis of partial\u000adifferential equations. Namely, the assumptions used in that theorem are\u000aexcessive to the extent of being unrealistic from practical point of view. The\u000atwo facts which the mentioned theorem gets wrong from practical point of view\u000aare : - the relationship between the convergence and stability of numerical\u000amethods for linear PDEs, - the effect of the propagation of round-off errors in\u000asuch numerical methods. The mentioned theorem leads to a result for PDEs which\u000ais unrealistically better than the well known best possible similar result in\u000athe numerical analysis of ODEs. Strangely enough, this fact seems not to be\u000aknown well enough in the literature. Once one becomes aware of the above, new\u000aavenues of both practical and theoretical interest can open up in the numerical\u000aanalysis of PDEs.

VMultiagent Control of Self-reconfigurable Robots
p734

VWe demonstrate how multiagent systems provide useful control techniques for\u000amodular self-reconfigurable (metamorphic) robots. Such robots consist of many\u000amodules that can move relative to each other, thereby changing the overall\u000ashape of the robot to suit different tasks. Multiagent control is particularly\u000awell-suited for tasks involving uncertain and changing environments. We\u000aillustrate this approach through simulation experiments of Proteo, a\u000ametamorphic robot system currently under development.

VDespite its great importance, modern network infrastructure is remarkable for\u000athe lack of rigor in its engineering. The Internet which began as a research\u000aexperiment was never designed to handle the users and applications it hosts\u000atoday. The lack of formalization of the Internet architecture meant limited\u000aabstractions and modularity, especially for the control and management planes,\u000athus requiring for every new need a new protocol built from scratch. This led\u000ato an unwieldy ossified Internet architecture resistant to any attempts at\u000aformal verification, and an Internet culture where expediency and pragmatism\u000aare favored over formal correctness. Fortunately, recent work in the space of\u000aclean slate Internet design---especially, the software defined networking (SDN)\u000aparadigm---offers the Internet community another chance to develop the right\u000akind of architecture and abstractions. This has also led to a great resurgence\u000ain interest of applying formal methods to specification, verification, and\u000asynthesis of networking protocols and applications. In this paper, we present a\u000aself-contained tutorial of the formidable amount of work that has been done in\u000aformal methods, and present a survey of its applications to networking.

VThis paper, the first step to connect relational databases with systems\u000aconsequence (Kent: "System Consequence" 2009), is concerned with the semantics\u000aof relational databases. It aims to to study system consequence in the\u000alogical/semantic system of relational databases. The paper, which was inspired\u000aby and which extends a recent set of papers on the theory of relational\u000adatabase systems (Spivak: "Functorial Data Migration" 2012), is linked with\u000awork on the Information Flow Framework (IFF) [http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/]\u000aconnected with the ontology standards effort (SUO), since relational databases\u000anaturally embed into first order logic. The database semantics discussed here\u000ais concerned with the conceptual level of database architecture. We offer both\u000aan intuitive and technical discussion. Corresponding to the notions of primary\u000aand foreign keys, relational database semantics takes two forms: a\u000adistinguished form where entities are distinguished from relations, and a\u000aunified form where relations and entities coincide. The distinguished form\u000acorresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Simplicial databases"\u000a2009)[arXiv:0904.2012]. The unified form, a special case of the distinguished\u000aform, corresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Functorial Data\u000aMigration" 2012). A later paper will discuss various formalisms of relational\u000adatabases, such as relational algebra and first order logic, and will complete\u000athe description of the relational database logical environment.

VA large number of computational scientific research projects make use of open\u000asource software packages. However, the development process of such tools\u000afrequently differs from conventional software development; partly because of\u000athe nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fully\u000aunderstood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried out\u000aby scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices of\u000asoftware engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressure\u000ato publish scientific results and that credit for software development is\u000alimited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering like\u000amodular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and software\u000aintegration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to be\u000adisregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovative\u000adevelopments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to master\u000adevelopment for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions. The growing\u000acomplexity of research, however, requires suitable and maintainable\u000acomputational tools, resulting in a widening gap between the potential users\u000a(often growing in number) and contributors to the development of such a\u000apackage.

The\u000aarchitecture is based on the use of picking views and inverse transforms from\u000athe graphics to the data. With three examples of graphical interaction, we show\u000ahow to express them with the architecture, how to implement them, and how this\u000aimproves programming usability. Moreover, we show that it enables implementing\u000agraphical interaction without a scene graph. This kind of code prevents from\u000aerrors due to cache consistency management.

In this paper we examine the state of\u000athe DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to\u000athe co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital\u000alibrary conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract\u000aseveral established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define\u000a$AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the\u000anetwork. The results are validated against conference program committee members\u000ain the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and\u000aAuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also\u000ainvestigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint\u000aConference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).

In experiments with 1303 Bible\u000atranslations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity\u000aof multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors\u000acapture genetic relationships between languages.

We also discuss the\u000asolution existence in finite time-length and its site density in continuous\u000alimit, and apply our approach to the pendulum with periodic perturbation.

VEvolutionary processes proved very useful for solving optimization problems.\u000aIn this work, we build a formalization of the notion of cooperation and\u000acompetition of multiple systems working toward a common optimization goal of\u000athe population using evolutionary computation techniques. It is justified that\u000aevolutionary algorithms are more expressive than conventional recursive\u000aalgorithms. Three subclasses of evolutionary algorithms are proposed here:\u000abounded finite, unbounded finite and infinite types. Some results on\u000acompleteness, optimality and search decidability for the above classes are\u000apresented. A natural extension of Evolutionary Turing Machine model developed\u000ain this paper allows one to mathematically represent and study properties of\u000acooperation and competition in a population of optimized species.

The paper formalizes views over such databases as\u000aindefinite deductive databases, and defines for them several classes of\u000adatabase repairs that realize view-update requests. Most notable is the class\u000aof constrained repairs. Constrained repairs change the database "minimally" and\u000aavoid making arbitrary commitments. They narrow down the space of alternative\u000aways to fulfill the view-update request to those that are grounded, in a\u000acertain strong sense, in the database, the view and the view-update request.

The research has been developed under the SocRob project, carried\u000aout by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the Institute for Systems and\u000aRobotics - Instituto Superior Tecnico (ISR/IST) in Lisbon. The acronym of the\u000aproject stands both for "Society of Robots" and "Soccer Robots", the case study\u000awhere we are testing our population of robots. Designing soccer robots is a\u000avery challenging problem, where the robots must act not only to shoot a ball\u000atowards the goal, but also to detect and avoid static (walls, stopped robots)\u000aand dynamic (moving robots) obstacles. Furthermore, they must cooperate to\u000adefeat an opposing team. Our past and current research in soccer robotics\u000aincludes cooperative sensor fusion for world modeling, object recognition and\u000atracking, robot navigation, multi-robot distributed task planning and\u000acoordination, including cooperative reinforcement learning in cooperative and\u000aadversarial environments, and behavior-based architectures for real time task\u000aexecution of cooperating robot teams.

This gives the ability to perform the\u000adata processing that usually takes a long processing time on a classical\u000adatabase system, in a simultaneous way on a quantum computer.

VExploiting Anonymity in Approximate Linear Programming: Scaling to Large\u000a  Multiagent MDPs (Extended Version)
p1007
sg124
VMany exact and approximate solution methods for Markov Decision Processes\u000a(MDPs) attempt to exploit structure in the problem and are based on\u000afactorization of the value function. Especially multiagent settings, however,\u000aare known to suffer from an exponential increase in value component sizes as\u000ainteractions become denser, meaning that approximation architectures are\u000arestricted in the problem sizes and types they can handle. We present an\u000aapproach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems,\u000aexploiting a property that can be thought of as "anonymous influence" in the\u000afactored MDP. Anonymous influence summarizes joint variable effects efficiently\u000awhenever the explicit representation of variable identity in the problem can be\u000aavoided. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into\u000acomputational efficiencies, both for general variable elimination in a factor\u000agraph but in particular also for the approximate linear programming solution to\u000afactored MDPs. The latter allows to scale linear programming to factored MDPs\u000athat were previously unsolvable. Our results are shown for the control of a\u000astochastic disease process over a densely connected graph with 50 nodes and 25\u000aagents.

VThe Internet Protocol (IP) is the lifeblood of the modern Internet. Its\u000asimplicity and universality have fueled the unprecedented and lasting global\u000asuccess of the current Internet. Nonetheless, some limitations of IP have been\u000aemerging in recent years. Its original design envisaged supporting perhaps tens\u000aof thousands of static hosts operating in a friendly academic-like setting,\u000amainly in order to facilitate email communication and remote access to scarce\u000acomputing resources. At present IP interconnects billions of static and mobile\u000adevices (ranging from supercomputers to IoT gadgets) with a large and dynamic\u000aset of popular applications. Starting in mid-1990s, the advent of mobility,\u000awirelessness and the web substantially shifted Internet usage and communication\u000aparadigms. This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet\u000aarchitecture and prompted interest in alternative designs.\u000a  The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters\u000aof efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures.\u000aAs a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized "security and privacy by\u000adesign" in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching\u000aand retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this\u000aend, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects\u000awere funded by the NSF in 2010: Nebula, Named-Data Networking (NDN),\u000aMobilityFirst (MF), and Expressive Internet Architecture (XIA). This paper\u000aprovides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy\u000afeatures (and issues) in these NSF-funded Future Internet Architectures. It\u000aalso compares the four candidate designs with the current IP-based architecture\u000aand discusses similarities, differences, and possible improvements.

The MPEG-21 Digital\u000aItem Declaration (MPEG-21 DID) is another standard specifying the\u000arepresentation of digital assets in XML that, so far, has received little\u000aattention in the digital library community. This article gives a brief insight\u000ainto the MPEG-21 standardization effort, highlights the major characteristics\u000aof the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model, and describes the MPEG-21 Digital Item\u000aDeclaration Language (MPEG-21 DIDL), an XML syntax for the representation of\u000adigital assets based on the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model. Also, it briefly\u000ademonstrates the potential relevance of MPEG-21 DID to the digital library\u000acommunity by describing its use in the aDORe repository environment at the\u000aResearch Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for the\u000arepresentation of digital assets.

VThis decade has seen a great deal of progress in the development of\u000ainformation retrieval systems. Unfortunately, we still lack a systematic\u000aunderstanding of the behavior of the systems and their relationship with\u000adocuments. In this paper we present a completely new approach towards the\u000aunderstanding of the information retrieval systems. Recently, it has been\u000aobserved that retrieval systems in TREC 6 show some remarkable patterns in\u000aretrieving relevant documents. Based on the TREC 6 observations, we introduce a\u000ageometric linear model of information retrieval systems. We then apply the\u000amodel to predict the number of relevant documents by the retrieval systems. The\u000amodel is also scalable to a much larger data set. Although the model is\u000adeveloped based on the TREC 6 routing test data, I believe it can be readily\u000aapplicable to other information retrieval systems. In Appendix, we explained a\u000asimple and efficient way of making a better system from the existing systems.

VFrom the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for\u000athe activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning\u000aapplications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental\u000atheoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is\u000aconstrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the\u000aTuring Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe\u000aitself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the\u000apresent paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy\u000apoint of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination\u000aof learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying\u000aagent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the\u000aproblem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in\u000areality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for\u000alearning Turing machines.

VWe show that there are Turing complete computably enumerable sets of\u000aarbitrarily low non-trivial initial segment prefix-free complexity. In\u000aparticular, given any computably enumerable set $A$ with non-trivial\u000aprefix-free initial segment complexity, there exists a Turing complete\u000acomputably enumerable set $B$ with complexity strictly less than the complexity\u000aof $A$. On the other hand it is known that sets with trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity are not Turing complete.\u000a  Moreover we give a generalization of this result for any finite collection of\u000acomputably enumerable sets $A_i, i<k$ with non-trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity. An application of this gives a negative answer to a\u000aquestion from \u005ccite[Section 11.12]{rodenisbook} and \u005ccite{MRmerstcdhdtd} which\u000aasked for minimal pairs in the structure of the c.e.\u005c reals ordered by their\u000ainitial segment prefix-free complexity.\u000a  Further consequences concern various notions of degrees of randomness. For\u000aexample, the Solovay degrees and the $K$-degrees of computably enumerable reals\u000aand computably enumerable sets are not elementarily equivalent. Also, the\u000adegrees of randomness based on plain and prefix-free complexity are not\u000aelementarily equivalent; the same holds for their $\u005cDelta^0_2$ and $\u005cSigma^0_1$\u000asubstructures.

VModern cyber-physical systems (CPS) have a close inter-dependence between\u000asoftware and physical components. Automotive embedded systems are typical CPS,\u000aas physical chips, sensors and actuators are physical components and software\u000aembedded within are the cyber components. The current stage of embedded systems\u000ais highly complex in architecture design for both software and hardware. It is\u000acommon in industrial practice that high level control algorithm development and\u000alow level code implementation on hardware platforms are developed separately\u000awith limited shared information. However, software code and hardware\u000aarchitecture become closely related with the increasing complexity. Correlated\u000arequirements and dependencies between hardware and software are emerging\u000aproblems of industrial practice.

VGitHub is the most widely used social, distributed version control system. It\u000ahas around 10 million registered users and hosts over 16 million public\u000arepositories. Its user base is also very active as GitHub ranks in the top 100\u000aAlexa most popular websites. In this study, we collect GitHub's state in its\u000aentirety. Doing so, allows us to study new aspects of the ecosystem. Although\u000aGitHub is the home to millions of users and repositories, the analysis of\u000ausers' activity time-series reveals that only around 10% of them can be\u000aconsidered active. The collected dataset allows us to investigate the\u000apopularity of programming languages and existence of pattens in the relations\u000abetween users, repositories, and programming languages.\u000a  By, applying a k-means clustering method to the users-repositories commits\u000amatrix, we find that two clear clusters of programming languages separate from\u000athe remaining. One cluster forms for "web programming" languages (Java Script,\u000aRuby, PHP, CSS), and a second for "system oriented programming" languages (C,\u000aC++, Python). Further classification, allow us to build a phylogenetic tree of\u000athe use of programming languages in GitHub. Additionally, we study the main and\u000athe auxiliary programming languages of the top 1000 repositories in more\u000adetail. We provide a ranking of these auxiliary programming languages using\u000avarious metrics, such as percentage of lines of code, and PageRank.

VMultimedia reasoning, which is suitable for, among others, multimedia content\u000aanalysis and high-level video scene interpretation, relies on the formal and\u000acomprehensive conceptualization of the represented knowledge domain. However,\u000amost multimedia ontologies are not exhaustive in terms of role definitions, and\u000ado not incorporate complex role inclusions and role interdependencies. In fact,\u000amost multimedia ontologies do not have a role box at all, and implement only a\u000abasic subset of the available logical constructors. Consequently, their\u000aapplication in multimedia reasoning is limited. To address the above issues,\u000aVidOnt, the very first multimedia ontology with SROIQ(D) expressivity and a\u000aDL-safe ruleset has been introduced for next-generation multimedia reasoning.\u000aIn contrast to the common practice, the formal grounding has been set in one of\u000athe most expressive description logics, and the ontology validated with\u000aindustry-leading reasoners, namely HermiT and FaCT++. This paper also presents\u000abest practices for developing multimedia ontologies, based on my ontology\u000aengineering approach.

The physical interaction\u000amethodology is modeled directly after ubiquitous mechanical sliders and dimmers\u000awhich tend to be used for intensity/volume control. Our abstraction to a\u000apressure-sensitive touchpad provides advantages and introduces additional\u000abenefits over such existing devices.

VThis paper investigates the impact of three approaches to XML retrieval:\u000ausing Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; using eXist, a native\u000aXML database; and using a hybrid system that takes full article answers from\u000aZettair and uses eXist to extract elements from those articles. For the\u000acontent-only topics, we undertake a preliminary analysis of the INEX 2003\u000arelevance assessments in order to identify the types of highly relevant\u000adocument components. Further analysis identifies two complementary sub-cases of\u000arelevance assessments ("General" and "Specific") and two categories of topics\u000a("Broad" and "Narrow"). We develop a novel retrieval module that for a\u000acontent-only topic utilises the information from the resulting answer list of a\u000anative XML database and dynamically determines the preferable units of\u000aretrieval, which we call "Coherent Retrieval Elements". The results of our\u000aexperiments show that -- when each of the three systems is evaluated against\u000adifferent retrieval scenarios (such as different cases of relevance\u000aassessments, different topic categories and different choices of evaluation\u000ametrics) -- the XML retrieval systems exhibit varying behaviour and the best\u000aperformance can be reached for different values of the retrieval parameters. In\u000athe case of INEX 2003 relevance assessments for the content-only topics, our\u000anewly developed hybrid XML retrieval system is substantially more effective\u000athan either Zettair or eXist, and yields a robust and a very effective XML\u000aretrieval.

VA model-driven approach to broaden the detection of software performance\u000a  antipatterns at runtime
p1285
sg95
VPerformance antipatterns document bad design patterns that have negative\u000ainfluence on system performance. In our previous work we formalized such\u000aantipatterns as logical predicates that predicate on four views: (i) the static\u000aview that captures the software elements (e.g. classes, components) and the\u000astatic relationships among them; (ii) the dynamic view that represents the\u000ainteraction (e.g. messages) that occurs between the software entities elements\u000ato provide the system functionalities; (iii) the deployment view that describes\u000athe hardware elements (e.g. processing nodes) and the mapping of the software\u000aentities onto the hardware platform; (iv) the performance view that collects\u000aspecific performance indices. In this paper we present a lightweight\u000ainfrastructure that is able to detect performance antipatterns at runtime\u000athrough monitoring. The proposed approach precalculates such predicates and\u000aidentifies antipatterns whose static, dynamic and deployment sub-predicates are\u000avalidated by the current system configuration and brings at runtime the\u000averification of performance sub-predicates. The proposed infrastructure\u000aleverages model-driven techniques to generate probes for monitoring the\u000aperformance sub-predicates and detecting antipatterns at runtime.

Approach: In this study, we proposed an efficient database\u000awatermarking algorithm based on inserting binary image watermarks in\u000anon-numeric mutli-word attributes of selected database tuples. Results: The\u000aalgorithm is robust as it resists attempts to remove or degrade the embedded\u000awatermark and it is blind as it does not require the original database in order\u000ato extract the embedded watermark. Conclusion: Experimental results\u000ademonstrated blindness and the robustness of the algorithm against common\u000adatabase attacks.

VA Metric for Performance Portability
p1335

VThe term "performance portability" has been informally used in computing to\u000arefer to a variety of notions which generally include: 1) the ability to run\u000aone application across multiple hardware platforms; and 2) achieving some\u000anotional level of performance on these platforms. However, there has been a\u000anoticeable lack of consensus on the precise meaning of the term, and authors'\u000aconclusions regarding their success (or failure) to achieve performance\u000aportability have thus been subjective. Comparing one approach to performance\u000aportability with another has generally been marked with vague claims and\u000averbose, qualitative explanation of the comparison. This paper presents a\u000aconcise definition for performance portability, along with a simple metric that\u000aaccurately captures the performance and portability of an application across\u000adifferent platforms. The utility of this metric is then demonstrated with a\u000aretroactive application to previous work.

VSoftware Autotuning for Sustainable Performance Portability

VScientific software applications are increasingly developed by large\u000ainterdiscplinary teams operating on functional modules organized around a\u000acommon software framework, which is capable of integrating new functional\u000acapabilities without modifying the core of the framework. In such environment,\u000asoftware correctness and modularity take precedence at the expense of code\u000aperformance, which is an important concern during execution on supercomputing\u000afacilities, where the allocation of core-hours is a valuable resource. To\u000aalleviate the performance problems, we propose automated performance tuning\u000a(autotuning) of software to extract the maximum performance on a given hardware\u000aplatform and to enable performance portability across heterogeneous hardware\u000aplatforms. The resulting code remains generic without committing to a\u000aparticular software stack and yet is compile-time specializable for maximal\u000asustained performance.

VA Multiagent Simulation for Traffic Flow Management with Evolutionary\u000a  Optimization
p1410
sg124
VA traffic flow is one of the main transportation issues in nowadays\u000aindustrialized agglomerations. Configuration of traffic lights is among the key\u000aaspects in traffic flow management. This paper proposes an evolutionary\u000aoptimization tool that utilizes multiagent simulator in order to obtain\u000aaccurate model. Even though more detailed studies are still necessary, a\u000apreliminary research gives an expectation for promising results.

VDiscrete Euclidian Spaces (DESs) are the beginning of a journey without\u000areturn towards the discretization of mathematics. Important mathematical\u000aconcepts- such as the idea of number or the systems of numeration, whose formal\u000adefinition is currently independent of Euclidean spaces -have in the\u000aIsodimensional Discrete Mathematics (IDM) their roots in the DESs. This\u000amathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional\u000amathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the\u000aorthodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic\u000atool, or perhaps just "a simple curiosity." However, the IDM dis-crete\u000aapproaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.

VThe Web is our primary source of all kinds of information today. This\u000aincludes information about software as well as associated materials, like\u000asource code, documentation, related publications and change logs. Such data is\u000aof particular importance in research in order to conduct, comprehend and\u000areconstruct scientific experiments that involve software. swMATH, a\u000amathematical software directory, attempts to identify software mentions in\u000ascientific articles and provides additional information as well as links to the\u000aWeb. However, just like software itself, the Web is dynamic and most likely the\u000ainformation on the Web has changed since it was referenced in a scientific\u000apublication. Therefore, it is crucial to preserve the resources of a software\u000aon the Web to capture its states over time.\u000a  We found that around 40% of the websites in swMATH are already included in an\u000aexisting Web archive. Out of these, 60% of contain some kind of documentation\u000aand around 45% even provide downloads of software artifacts. Hence, already\u000atoday links can be established based on the publication dates of corresponding\u000aarticles. The contained data enable enriching existing information with a\u000atemporal dimension. In the future, specialized infrastructure will improve the\u000acoverage of software resources and allow explicit references in scientific\u000apublications.

VAffective multimedia documents such as images, sounds or videos elicit\u000aemotional responses in exposed human subjects. These stimuli are stored in\u000aaffective multimedia databases and successfully used for a wide variety of\u000aresearch in psychology and neuroscience in areas related to attention and\u000aemotion processing. Although important all affective multimedia databases have\u000anumerous deficiencies which impair their applicability. These problems, which\u000aare brought forward in the paper, result in low recall and precision of\u000amultimedia stimuli retrieval which makes creating emotion elicitation\u000aprocedures difficult and labor-intensive. To address these issues a new core\u000aontology STIMONT is introduced. The STIMONT is written in OWL-DL formalism and\u000aextends W3C EmotionML format with an expressive and formal representation of\u000aaffective concepts, high-level semantics, stimuli document metadata and the\u000aelicited physiology. The advantages of ontology in description of affective\u000amultimedia stimuli are demonstrated in a document retrieval experiment and\u000acompared against contemporary keyword-based querying methods. Also, a software\u000atool Intelligent Stimulus Generator for retrieval of affective multimedia and\u000aconstruction of stimuli sequences is presented.

VA mathematical formalism for agent-based modeling
p1455
sg124
VMany complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\u000aconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\u000asuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\u000aagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\u000athey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\u000acan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\u000avalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\u000aframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\u000aestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\u000amathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\u000asuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\u000aand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\u000asampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\u000adynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\u000aof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\u000auniversal model for computation.

After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next.

VNowadays, graph databases are employed when relationships between entities\u000aare in the scope of database queries to avoid performance-critical join\u000aoperations of relational databases. Graph queries are used to query and modify\u000agraphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching\u000athat is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be\u000aemployed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern\u000amatches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query\u000aperformance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with\u000athe graphs stored in the graph database.\u000a  In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as\u000atechnique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental\u000amaintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively\u000aand declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our\u000amaintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the\u000agraph database increases. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our approach\u000acan outperform existing approaches for the incremental maintenance of graph\u000aquery results.

VThis is a short description of graphic lambda calculus, with special emphasis\u000aon a duality suggested by the two different appearances of knot diagrams, in\u000alambda calculus and emergent algebra sectors of the graphic lambda calculus\u000arespectively. This duality leads to the introduction of the dual of the graphic\u000abeta move. While the graphic beta move corresponds to beta reduction in untyped\u000alambda calculus, the dual graphic beta move appears in relation to emergent\u000aalgebras.

VThe Dark Side of Ethical Robots
p1670
sg152
VConcerns over the risks associated with advances in Artificial Intelligence\u000ahave prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI,\u000aincluding machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating\u000athe development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally,\u000aevaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices.\u000aThis emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years.\u000aHowever, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging\u000afield of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily\u000afacilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show\u000athat it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves\u000acompetitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific\u000aAI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make\u000aunethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee\u000athe responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we\u000aconclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of\u000aengineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by\u000alegislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to\u000aincrease the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.

VStructure Learning of Probabilistic Graphical Models: A Comprehensive\u000a  Survey

VProbabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability\u000atheory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified\u000adescription of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical\u000amodel. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful\u000aproperties:\u000a  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the\u000astructures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to\u000adesign and motivate new models.\u000a  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the\u000amodel, including the conditional independence properties.\u000a  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning\u000ain sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations,\u000ain which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\u000a  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including\u000abioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing\u000aanalysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models\u000aremains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over\u000athe space of all possible structures.\u000a  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure\u000alearning algorithms.

VClustering problems have numerous applications and are becoming more\u000achallenging as the size of the data increases. In this paper, we consider\u000adesigning clustering algorithms that can be used in MapReduce, the most popular\u000aprogramming environment for processing large datasets. We focus on the\u000apractical and popular clustering problems, $k$-center and $k$-median. We\u000adevelop fast clustering algorithms with constant factor approximation\u000aguarantees. From a theoretical perspective, we give the first analysis that\u000ashows several clustering algorithms are in $\u005cmathcal{MRC}^0$, a theoretical\u000aMapReduce class introduced by Karloff et al. \u005ccite{KarloffSV10}. Our algorithms\u000ause sampling to decrease the data size and they run a time consuming clustering\u000aalgorithm such as local search or Lloyd's algorithm on the resulting data set.\u000aOur algorithms have sufficient flexibility to be used in practice since they\u000arun in a constant number of MapReduce rounds. We complement these results by\u000aperforming experiments using our algorithms. We compare the empirical\u000aperformance of our algorithms to several sequential and parallel algorithms for\u000athe $k$-median problem. The experiments show that our algorithms' solutions are\u000asimilar to or better than the other algorithms' solutions. Furthermore, on data\u000asets that are sufficiently large, our algorithms are faster than the other\u000aparallel algorithms that we tested.

VA Performance Analysis Tool for Nokia Mobile Phone Software

VPerformance problems are often observed in embedded software systems. The\u000areasons for poor performance are frequently not obvious. Bottlenecks can occur\u000ain any of the software components along the execution path. Therefore it is\u000aimportant to instrument and monitor the different components contributing to\u000athe runtime behavior of an embedded software system. Performance analysis tools\u000acan help locate performance bottlenecks in embedded software systems by\u000amonitoring the software's execution and producing easily understandable\u000aperformance data. We maintain and further develop a tool for analyzing the\u000aperformance of Nokia mobile phone software.

Each\u000aof these reports provides important information about where execution time is\u000abeing spent. The demo will show how the tool helps to identify performance\u000abottlenecks in Nokia mobile phone software and better understand areas of poor\u000aperformance.

Use of recursion theory in\u000apattern recognition shows connection between a recognition algorithm comparison\u000aproblem and complexity problems of oracle computation. That is because in many\u000acases we can take into account only the number of sign computations or in other\u000awords volume of oracle information needed. Therefore, the problem of\u000arecognition algorithm preference can be formulated as a complexity optimization\u000aproblem of oracle computation. Furthermore, introducing a certain "natural"\u000apreference relation on a set of recognizing algorithms, we discover it to be\u000anontransitive. This relates to the well known nontransitivity paradox in\u000aprobability theory.\u000a  Keywords: Pattern Recognition, Recursion Theory, Nontransitivity, Preference\u000aRelation

VLong-Lived Distributed Relative Localization of Robot Swarms
p1745
sg152
VThis paper studies the problem of having mobile robots in a multi-robot\u000asystem maintain an estimate of the relative position and relative orientation\u000aof near-by robots in the environment. This problem is studied in the context of\u000alarge swarms of simple robots which are capable of measuring only the distance\u000ato near-by robots.\u000a  We present two distributed localization algorithms with different trade-offs\u000abetween their computational complexity and their coordination requirements. The\u000afirst algorithm does not require the robots to coordinate their motion. It\u000arelies on a non-linear least squares based strategy to allow robots to compute\u000athe relative pose of near-by robots. The second algorithm borrows tools from\u000adistributed computing theory to coordinate which robots must remain stationary\u000aand which robots are allowed to move. This coordination allows the robots to\u000ause standard trilateration techniques to compute the relative pose of near-by\u000arobots. Both algorithms are analyzed theoretically and validated through\u000asimulations.

VPerformance Evaluation of Security Protocols
p1750

VWe propose a comparative performance evaluation of security protocols. The\u000anovelty of our approach lies in the use of a polynomial mathematical model that\u000acaptures the performance of classes of cryptographic algorithms instead of\u000acapturing the performance of each algorithm separately, approach that is used\u000ain other papers. A major advantage of using such a model is that it does not\u000arequire implementation-specific information, because the decision is based on\u000acomparing the estimated performances of protocols instead of actually\u000aevaluating them. The approach is validated by comparatively evaluating the\u000aperformances of 1000 automatically generated security protocols against the\u000aperformances of their actual implementations.

VThe paper is devoted to hyperbolic (generally speaking, non-Lagrangian and\u000anonlinear) partial differential systems possessing a full set of differential\u000aoperators that map any function of one independent variable into a symmetry of\u000athe corresponding system. We demonstrate that a system has the above property\u000aif and only if this system admits a full set of formal integrals (i.e.\u000adifferential operators which map symmetries into integrals of the system). As a\u000aconsequence, such systems possess both direct and inverse Noether operators (in\u000athe terminology of a work by B. Fuchssteiner and A.S. Fokas who have used these\u000aterms for operators that map cosymmetries into symmetries and back). Systems\u000aadmitting Noether operators are not exhausted by Euler-Lagrange systems and the\u000asystems with formal integrals. In particular, a hyperbolic system admits an\u000ainverse Noether operator if a differential substitution maps this system into a\u000asystem possessing an inverse Noether operator.

VDatabases, collections of related data, are as old as the written word. A\u000adatabase can be anything from a homemaker's metal recipe file to a\u000asophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we\u000ainvariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management\u000asystems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box\u000aor cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How\u000adid the computerized database evolve?\u000a  This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the\u000adatabase, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now\u000astandard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early\u000acomputerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed\u000aSequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage\u000amethods. Early database models are explored including the network and\u000ahierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and\u000aobject-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams,\u000aincluding hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity\u000arelationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to\u000asupport the text.\u000a  This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS\u000adevelopment. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into\u000athe relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented\u000adevelopment methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS.

VOrientation and Motion Sensing are widely implemented on various consumer\u000aproducts, such as mobile phones, tablets and cameras as they enable immediate\u000ainteraction with virtual information. The prototyping phase of any orientation\u000aand motion sensing capable device is however a quite difficult process as it\u000amay involve complex hardware designing, math algorithms and programming.\u000a  In this paper, we present FreeIMU, an Open Hardware Framework for prototyping\u000aorientation and motion sensing capable devices. The framework consists in a\u000asmall circuit board containing various sensors and a software library, built on\u000atop of the Arduino platform. Both the hardware and library are released under\u000aopen licences and supported by an active community allowing to be implemented\u000ainto research and commercial projects.

VDeconstruction of Infinite Extensive Games using coinduction
p1938

VFinite objects and more specifically finite games are formalized using\u000ainduction, whereas infinite objects are formalized using coinduction. In this\u000aarticle, after an introduction to the concept of coinduction, we revisit on\u000ainfinite (discrete) extensive games the basic notions of game theory. Among\u000aothers, we introduce a definition of Nash equilibrium and a notion of subgame\u000aperfect equilibrium for infinite games. We use those concepts to analyze well\u000aknown infinite games, like the dollar auction game and the centipede game and\u000awe show that human behaviors that are often considered as illogic are perfectly\u000arational, if one admits that human agents reason coinductively.

VControl of Networked Multiagent Systems with Uncertain Graph Topologies
p1943
sg124
VMultiagent systems consist of agents that locally exchange information\u000athrough a physical network subject to a graph topology. Current control methods\u000afor networked multiagent systems assume the knowledge of graph topologies in\u000aorder to design distributed control laws for achieving desired global system\u000abehaviors. However, this assumption may not be valid for situations where graph\u000atopologies are subject to uncertainties either due to changes in the physical\u000anetwork or the presence of modeling errors especially for multiagent systems\u000ainvolving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this\u000astandpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent\u000asystems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a\u000acontroller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in\u000aresponse to system variations. Specifically, we analytically show that the\u000aproposed controller drives the trajectories of a networked multiagent system\u000asubject to a graph topology with time-varying uncertainties to a close\u000aneighborhood of the trajectories of a given reference model having a desired\u000agraph topology. As a special case, we also show that a networked multi-agent\u000asystem subject to a graph topology with constant uncertainties asymptotically\u000aconverges to the trajectories of a given reference model. Although the main\u000aresult of this paper is presented in the context of average consensus problem,\u000athe proposed framework can be used for many other problems related to networked\u000amultiagent systems with uncertain graph topologies.

VDue to the extensive use of information technology and the recent\u000adevelopments in multimedia systems, the amount of multimedia data available to\u000ausers has increased exponentially. Video is an example of multimedia data as it\u000acontains several kinds of data such as text, image, meta-data, visual and\u000aaudio. Content based video retrieval is an approach for facilitating the\u000asearching and browsing of large multimedia collections over WWW. In order to\u000acreate an effective video retrieval system, visual perception must be taken\u000ainto account. We conjectured that a technique which employs multiple features\u000afor indexing and retrieval would be more effective in the discrimination and\u000asearch tasks of videos. In order to validate this, content based indexing and\u000aretrieval systems were implemented using color histogram, Texture feature\u000a(GLCM), edge density and motion..

VThree approaches to content-and-structure XML retrieval are analysed in this\u000apaper: first by using Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; second\u000aby using eXist, a native XML database, and third by using a hybrid XML\u000aretrieval system that uses eXist to produce the final answers from likely\u000arelevant articles retrieved by Zettair. INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics\u000acan be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as\u000afinal answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles\u000aas final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid\u000asystem improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For\u000aranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval\u000amodel that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of\u000aa native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements. The final\u000aresults of our experiments show that when the XML retrieval task focusses on\u000ahighly relevant elements our hybrid XML retrieval system with the Coherent\u000aRetrieval Elements module is 1.8 times more effective than Zettair and 3 times\u000amore effective than eXist, and yields an effective content-and-structure XML\u000aretrieval.

Rather than austerity versus\u000aspending, the dynamical model suggests that solving crises in western societies\u000ais possible with regulations that reduce the stability of the deciders, while\u000ashifting wealth in the direction of the people. This shall increase the\u000adynamics among socio-economic classes, further increasing fairness.

VHow Information Transfer works: interpretation of Information Contents\u000a  in Bayes Theorem. Understanding Negative Information
p1988
sg423
VIn a given space of models or hypothesis the individual information content\u000aof each of them is considered as opposed to the Shannon entropy that measures\u000athe average information content of the mentioned space. In particular\u000aexpressing Bayes Theorem in terms of the information contents associated to its\u000aprobabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the\u000asystem by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space.\u000aIt is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information\u000asources are generated: the Information Content Associated to the Evidence that\u000aalways introduces positive information, and the Information Content Associated\u000ato the Bayes Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the\u000aevidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and\u000athe likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference\u000abetween these two mentioned information contents, the information that arrives\u000ato a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric,\u000agiven by the difference of the two mentioned information contents called\u000atransfer information content which measures the information transferred to each\u000aof the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem\u000a(MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed\u000aallows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the\u000acounterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information.\u000aThe implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to\u000athe emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience\u000a(particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding) are proposed as\u000afurther work.

We derive a general dynamic\u000autility function for optimizing over these types of tasks, that takes into\u000aaccount the utility of each stage and the probability of observing user\u000afeedback. We apply our framework to experiments over TREC data in the dynamic\u000amulti page search scenario as a practical demonstration of its effectiveness\u000aand to frame the discussion of its use, its limitations and to compare it\u000aagainst the existing frameworks.

VMPI Derived Datatypes: Performance Expectations and Status Quo
p2053
sg95
VWe examine natural expectations on communication performance using MPI\u000aderived datatypes in comparison to the baseline, "raw" performance of\u000acommunicating simple, non-contiguous data layouts. We show that common MPI\u000alibraries sometimes violate these datatype performance expectations, and\u000adiscuss reasons why this happens, but also show cases where MPI libraries\u000aperform well. Our findings are in many ways surprising and disappointing.\u000aFirst, the performance of derived datatypes is sometimes worse than the\u000asemantically equivalent packing and unpacking using the corresponding MPI\u000afunctionality. Second, the communication performance equivalence stated in the\u000aMPI standard between a single contiguous datatype and the repetition of its\u000aconstituent datatype does not hold universally. Third, the heuristics that are\u000atypically employed by MPI libraries at type-commit time are insufficient to\u000aenforce natural performance guidelines, and better type normalization\u000aheuristics may have a significant performance impact. We show cases where all\u000athe MPI type constructors are necessary to achieve the expected performance for\u000acertain data layouts. We describe our benchmarking approach to verify the\u000adatatype performance guidelines, and present extensive verification results for\u000adifferent MPI libraries.

VThe goals of this research were to (1) determine if there is agreement both\u000aamongst viewers, and between viewers and the performer, about the extent to\u000awhich performances are authentic, and (2) ascertain whether or not performers\u000aand/or viewers can distinguish between authenticity and skill. An authentic\u000aperformance is one that is natural or genuine, while an inauthentic performance\u000afeels faked, forced, or imitative. Study participants were asked to rate the\u000aauthenticity and skill level of a series of videotaped performances by dancers\u000aand stand-up comedians. Performers also rated their own performances.\u000aAuthenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated.\u000aRatings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A\u000ahigher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of\u000aperformances for viewers than for performers suggests that viewers make less of\u000aa distinction between authenticity and skill than performers. The relationship\u000abetween authenticity and creativity is discussed.

We\u000adevelop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and\u000aassociated perspectives on technological emergence across the geographical,\u000asocial, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyse (with\u000apublication and patent data) three case-studies of emerging technologies in the\u000amedical domain. These are: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)\u000atesting technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase\u000a(TPMT) genetic testing. Given the flexibility (i.e. adaptability to different\u000asources of data) and granularity (i.e. applicability across multiple levels of\u000adata aggregation) of overlay mapping techniques, we argue that these techniques\u000acan favour the integration and comparison of results from different contexts\u000aand cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a 'distributed'\u000astrategic intelligence for analysts and decision-makers.

VFence - An Efficient Parser with Ambiguity Support for Model-Driven\u000a  Language Specification
p2188

VModel-based language specification has applications in the implementation of\u000alanguage processors, the design of domain-specific languages, model-driven\u000asoftware development, data integration, text mining, natural language\u000aprocessing, and corpus-based induction of models. Model-based language\u000aspecification decouples language design from language processing and, unlike\u000atraditional grammar-driven approaches, which constrain language designers to\u000aspecific kinds of grammars, it needs general parser generators able to deal\u000awith ambiguities. In this paper, we propose Fence, an efficient bottom-up\u000aparsing algorithm with lexical and syntactic ambiguity support that enables the\u000ause of model-based language specification in practice.

VProgramming patterns for sequential file access in the .NET Framework are\u000adescribed and the performance is measured. The default behavior provides\u000aexcellent performance on a single disk - 50 MBps both reading and writing.\u000aUsing large request sizes and doing file pre-allocation when possible have\u000aquantifiable benefits. When one considers disk arrays, .NET unbuffered IO\u000adelivers 800 MBps on a 16-disk array, but buffered IO delivers about 12% of\u000athat performance. Consequently, high-performance file and database utilities\u000aare still forced to use unbuffered IO for maximum sequential performance. The\u000areport is accompanied by downloadable source code that demonstrates the\u000aconcepts and code that was used to obtain these measurements.

We assume that the robot is\u000apowered by four thrust forces placed at the robot end effectors, namely the\u000arobot hands and feet. Then, the control objective is defined as the asymptotic\u000astabilization of the robot centroidal momentum. This objective allows us to\u000atrack a desired trajectory for the robot center of mass and keep small errors\u000abetween a reference orientation and the robot base frame. Stability and\u000aconvergence of the robot momentum are shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov.\u000aSimulations carried out on a model of the humanoid robot iCub verify the\u000asoundness of the proposed approach.

VThe University of Virginia received a grant of $1,000,000 from the Andrew W.\u000aMellon Foundation to enable the Library, in collaboration with Cornell\u000aUniversity, to build a digital object repository system based on the Flexible\u000aExtensible Digital Object and Repository Architecture (Fedora). The new system\u000ademonstrates how distributed digital library architecture can be deployed using\u000aweb-based technologies, including XML and Web services. The new system is\u000adesigned to be a foundation upon which interoperable web-based digital\u000alibraries can be built. Virginia and collaborating partners in the US and UK\u000awill evaluate the system using a diverse set of digital collections. The\u000asoftware will be made available to the public as an open-source release.

VWe introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological\u000adevelopments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for\u000athe collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different\u000atechnologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to\u000athe difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when\u000atechnologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and\u000aproviders of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading\u000ato microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and\u000acomputer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of\u000adifferent technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the\u000aspreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of\u000athe system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced\u000atechnologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.\u000aWe show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with\u000aa power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the\u000aspreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order\u000astatistics.

VThe mean shift algorithm is a non-parametric and iterative technique that has\u000abeen used for finding modes of an estimated probability density function. It\u000ahas been successfully employed in many applications in specific areas of\u000amachine vision, pattern recognition, and image processing. Although the mean\u000ashift algorithm has been used in many applications, a rigorous proof of its\u000aconvergence is still missing in the literature. In this paper we address the\u000aconvergence of the mean shift algorithm in the one-dimensional space and prove\u000athat the sequence generated by the mean shift algorithm is a monotone and\u000aconvergent sequence.

VIn this paper, we consider the phase retrieval problem in which one aims to\u000arecover a signal from the magnitudes of affine measurements. Let $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m \u005csubset {\u005cmathbb H}^d$ and ${\u005cmathbf b}=(b_1, \u005cldots,\u000ab_m)^\u005ctop\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^m$, where ${\u005cmathbb H}={\u005cmathbb R}$ or ${\u005cmathbb C}$.\u000aWe say $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf a}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ are affine phase retrievable\u000afor ${\u005cmathbb H}^d$ if any ${\u005cmathbf x}\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^d$ can be recovered from\u000athe magnitudes of the affine measurements $\u005c{|<{\u005cmathbf a}_j,{\u005cmathbf\u000ax}>+b_j|,\u005c, 1\u005cleq j\u005cleq m\u005c}$. We develop general framework for affine phase\u000aretrieval and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ to be affine phase retrievable. We establish\u000aresults on minimal measurements and generic measurements for affine phase\u000aretrieval as well as on sparse affine phase retrieval. In particular, we also\u000ahighlight some notable differences between affine phase retrieval and the\u000astandard phase retrieval in which one aims to recover a signal $\u005cmathbf x$ from\u000athe magnitudes of its linear measurements. In standard phase retrieval, one can\u000aonly recover $\u005cmathbf x$ up to a unimodular constant, while affine phase\u000aretrieval removes this ambiguity. We prove that unlike standard phase\u000aretrieval, the affine phase retrievable measurements $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ do not form an open set in ${\u005cmathbb\u000aH}^{m\u005ctimes d}\u005ctimes {\u005cmathbb H}^m$. Also in the complex setting, the standard\u000aphase retrieval requires $4d-O(\u005clog_2d)$ measurements, while the affine phase\u000aretrieval only needs $m=3d$ measurements.

VDue to the rapid growth of internet broadband access and proliferation of\u000amodern mobile devices, various types of multimedia (e.g. text, images, audios\u000aand videos) have become ubiquitously available anytime. Mobile device users\u000ausually store and use multimedia contents based on their personal interests and\u000apreferences. Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have however\u000aintroduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. In order to\u000atackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that\u000arecommend multimedia for mobile users. In this survey paper, we examine the\u000aimportance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of\u000athree smart communities, namely, mobile social learning, mobile event guide and\u000acontext-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that\u000athe implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems\u000acan improve mobile multimedia recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still\u000achallenges and open issues such as the incorporation of context and social\u000aproperties, which need to be tackled in order to generate accurate and\u000atrustworthy mobile multimedia recommendations.

VLanguage Segmentation
p2318
sg7
VLanguage segmentation consists in finding the boundaries where one language\u000aends and another language begins in a text written in more than one language.\u000aThis is important for all natural language processing tasks. The problem can be\u000asolved by training language models on language data. However, in the case of\u000alow- or no-resource languages, this is problematic. I therefore investigate\u000awhether unsupervised methods perform better than supervised methods when it is\u000adifficult or impossible to train supervised approaches. A special focus is\u000agiven to difficult texts, i.e. texts that are rather short (one sentence),\u000acontaining abbreviations, low-resource languages and non-standard language. I\u000acompare three approaches: supervised n-gram language models, unsupervised\u000aclustering and weakly supervised n-gram language model induction. I devised the\u000aweakly supervised approach in order to deal with difficult text specifically.\u000aIn order to test the approach, I compiled a small corpus of different text\u000atypes, ranging from one-sentence texts to texts of about 300 words. The weakly\u000asupervised language model induction approach works well on short and difficult\u000atexts, outperforming the clustering algorithm and reaching scores in the\u000avicinity of the supervised approach. The results look promising, but there is\u000aroom for improvement and a more thorough investigation should be undertaken.

VPlan or not: Remote Human-robot Teaming with Incomplete Task Information
p2343
sg152
VHuman-robot interaction can be divided into two categories based on the\u000aphysical distance between the human and robot: remote and proximal. In proximal\u000ainteraction, the human and robot often engage in close coordination; in remote\u000ainteraction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication\u000aconstraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote\u000ainteraction becomes more important. Thus far, human factor studies on\u000aautomation in remote human-robot interaction have been restricted to various\u000aforms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as a smart\u000amobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we\u000ainvestigate the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to\u000afacilitate peer-to-peer human-robot teaming, in which the human and robot are\u000aviewed as teammates that are physically separated. The human and robot share\u000athe same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel\u000auncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming\u000aperformance. One important difference between peer-to-peer teaming and\u000asupervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in peer-to-peer teaming can\u000aachieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified.\u000aHowever, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry.\u000aWhile information asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the\u000arobot choosing improper actions that negatively influence the teaming\u000aperformance. We aim to investigate the various trade-offs, e.g., mental\u000aworkload and situation awareness, between these two types of remote human-robot\u000ateaming.

VThe importance of security in database research has greatly increased over\u000athe years as most of critical functionality of the business and military\u000aenterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information\u000asystem and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on\u000aphysical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be\u000acompromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading\u000aavailability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology\u000aenvironment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database\u000aresearch community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to\u000athe database security. The database research community has thoughts about these\u000aissues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will\u000aexamine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the\u000aadaption of the research to the changing environment.

VMany appplications in computational science are sufficiently\u000acompute-intensive that they depend on the power of parallel computing for\u000aviability. For all but the "embarrassingly parallel" problems, the performance\u000adepends upon the level of granularity that can be achieved on the computer\u000aplatform.\u000a  Our computational particle physics applications require machines that can\u000asupport a wide range of granularities, but in general, compute-intensive\u000astate-of-the-art projects will require finely grained distributions. Of the\u000adifferent types of machines available for the task, we consider cluster\u000acomputers.\u000a  The use of clusters of commodity computers in high performance computing has\u000amany advantages including the raw price/performance ratio and the flexibility\u000aof machine configuration and upgrade. Here we focus on what is usually\u000aconsidered the weak point of cluster technology; the scaling behaviour when\u000afaced with a numerically intensive parallel computation. To this end we examine\u000athe scaling of our own applications from numerical quantum field theory on a\u000acluster and infer conclusions about the more general case.

VThe aim is to create reliable and verifiable fault detection software to\u000adetect abrupt changes in safety-critical dynamic systems. Fault detection\u000amethods are implemented as software on digital computers that monitor and\u000acontrol the system.

We examine the performance of those methods to detect different\u000afaults during flight in a closed-loop setup. All selected methods show\u000aacceptable detection performance. However, it is not possible to repeat the\u000atest for every possible conditions, inputs and fault scenarios.

We include\u000athe translated properties in software in the form of non-executable annotations\u000athat can be read by machine. Consequently, some high level functional\u000aproperties of the code can be verified by automatic software verification\u000atools.

The dynamics of the citations coming from the different\u000a"precursor" classes illuminates the mechanism of the emergence of new fields\u000aand give the possibility to make predictions about future technological\u000adevelopment. For the patent network the optimal value of the PageRank damping\u000afactor is close to 0.5; the application of d=0.85 leads to unacceptable ranking\u000aresults.

VBy systematically applying ten well-known and inequivalent two-part relations\u000abetween hypergeometric sums 3F2(...|1) to the published database of all such\u000asums, 62 new sums are obtained. The existing literature is summarized, and many\u000apurportedly novel results extracted from that literature are shown to be\u000aspecial cases of these new sums. The general problem of finding elements\u000acontiguous to Watson's, Dixon's and Whipple's theorems is reduced to a simple\u000aalgorithm suitable for machine computation. Several errors in the literature\u000aare corrected or noted. The present paper both summarizes and extends a\u000aprevious work on this subject.

VKeyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent\u000ayears because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured\u000aquery language nor to know the complex underlying database schemas. Most of\u000aexisting methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static\u000adatabases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users\u000amay have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation,\u000ait is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in a database system\u000ato support continual keyword queries.\u000a  In this paper, we propose an efficient method for answering continual top-$k$\u000akeyword queries over relational databases. The proposed method is built on an\u000aexisting scheme of keyword search on relational data streams, but incorporates\u000athe ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two\u000aimprovements to support efficient top-$k$ keyword search in relational\u000adatabases. Compared to the existing methods, our method is more efficient both\u000ain computing the top-$k$ results in a static database and in maintaining the\u000atop-$k$ results when the database continually being updated. Experimental\u000aresults validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

VAs machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of\u000ainterest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation\u000afor their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess\u000aother criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the\u000ainterest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what\u000ainterpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this\u000aposition paper, we first define interpretability and describe when\u000ainterpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy\u000afor rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous\u000ascience of interpretable machine learning.

VThere is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel\u000atechnologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of\u000astudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\u000aconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\u000adesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\u000aaims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\u000alinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\u000aoperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\u000acombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\u000a'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\u000aissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\u000aattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\u000aradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\u000aimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\u000aemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\u000aattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\u000ain, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\u000astudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\u000acitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\u000aand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\u000aattributes of emergence.

Our\u000aframework employs the modal logic of knowledge within the context of the runs\u000aand systems framework, much in the spirit of our earlier work on secrecy\u000a[Halpern and O'Neill 2002]. We give several definitions of anonymity with\u000arespect to agents, actions, and observers in multiagent systems, and we relate\u000aour definitions of anonymity to other definitions of information hiding, such\u000aas secrecy. We also give probabilistic definitions of anonymity that are able\u000ato quantify an observer s uncertainty about the state of the system. Finally,\u000awe relate our definitions of anonymity to other formalizations of anonymity and\u000ainformation hiding, including definitions of anonymity in the process algebra\u000aCSP and definitions of information hiding using function views.

The recognition of the patterns within the images\u000arelate closely to the spatiotemporal processes of edge formations, and its\u000aimplementation needs a crossdisciplanry approach in neuroscience, computing and\u000apattern recognition. In this review, the edge detectors are grouped in as edge\u000afeatures, gradients and sketch models, and some example applications are\u000aprovided for reference.

VConstructing ontologies from relational databases is an active research topic\u000ain the Semantic Web domain. While conceptual mapping rules/principles of\u000arelational databases and ontology structures are being proposed, several\u000asoftware modules or plug-ins are being developed to enable the automatic\u000aconversion of relational databases into ontologies. However, the correlation\u000abetween the resulting ontologies built automatically with plug-ins from\u000arelational databases and the database-to-ontology mapping principles has been\u000agiven little attention. This study reviews and applies two Prot\u005c'eg\u005c'e\u000aplug-ins, namely, DataMaster and OntoBase to automatically construct ontologies\u000afrom a relational database. The resulting ontologies are further analysed to\u000amatch their structures against the database-to-ontology mapping principles. A\u000acomparative analysis of the matching results reveals that OntoBase outperforms\u000aDataMaster in applying the database-to-ontology mapping principles for\u000aautomatically converting relational databases into ontologies.

VNTsort is an external sort on WindowsNT 5.0. It has minimal functionality but\u000aexcellent price performance. In particular, running on mail-order hardware it\u000acan sort 1.5 GB for a penny. For commercially available sorts, Postman Sort\u000afrom Robert Ramey Software Development has elapsed time performance comparable\u000ato NTsort, while using less processor time. It can sort 1.27 GB for a penny\u000a(12.7 million records.) These sorts set new price-performance records. This\u000apaper documents this and proposes that the PennySort benchmark be revised to\u000aPerformance/Price sort: a simple GB/$ sort metric based on a two-pass external\u000asort.

VThree emerging technologies in physics education are evaluated from the\u000ainterdisciplinary perspective of cognitive science and physics education\u000aresearch. The technologies - Physlet Physics, the Andes Intelligent Tutoring\u000aSystem (ITS), and Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (MBL) Tools - are assessed\u000aparticularly in terms of their potential at promoting conceptual change,\u000adeveloping expert-like problem-solving skills, and achieving the goals of the\u000atraditional physics laboratory. Pedagogical methods to maximize the potential\u000aof each educational technology are suggested.
