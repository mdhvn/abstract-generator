VThis paper, the first step to connect relational databases with systems\u000aconsequence (Kent: "System Consequence" 2009), is concerned with the semantics\u000aof relational databases. It aims to to study system consequence in the\u000alogical/semantic system of relational databases. The paper, which was inspired\u000aby and which extends a recent set of papers on the theory of relational\u000adatabase systems (Spivak: "Functorial Data Migration" 2012), is linked with\u000awork on the Information Flow Framework (IFF) [http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/]\u000aconnected with the ontology standards effort (SUO), since relational databases\u000anaturally embed into first order logic. The database semantics discussed here\u000ais concerned with the conceptual level of database architecture. We offer both\u000aan intuitive and technical discussion. Corresponding to the notions of primary\u000aand foreign keys, relational database semantics takes two forms: a\u000adistinguished form where entities are distinguished from relations, and a\u000aunified form where relations and entities coincide. The distinguished form\u000acorresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Simplicial databases"\u000a2009)[arXiv:0904.2012]. The unified form, a special case of the distinguished\u000aform, corresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Functorial Data\u000aMigration" 2012). A later paper will discuss various formalisms of relational\u000adatabases, such as relational algebra and first order logic, and will complete\u000athe description of the relational database logical environment.

VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

This utility, fb_dump and fb_load,\u000afor dumping and loading respectively, retrieves each database table using\u000akinterbasdb and serializes the data using marshal module. This utility has two\u000aadvantages over the standard Firebird database backup utility, gbak. Firstly,\u000ait is able to backup and restore single database tables which might help to\u000arecover corrupted databases. Secondly, the output is in text-coded format (from\u000amarshal module) making it more resilient than a compressed text backup, as in\u000athe case of using gbak.

VThis paper addresses the problem of representing the set of repairs of a\u000apossibly inconsistent database by means of a disjunctive database.\u000aSpecifically, the class of denial constraints is considered. We show that,\u000agiven a database and a set of denial constraints, there exists a (unique)\u000adisjunctive database, called canonical, which represents the repairs of the\u000adatabase w.r.t. the constraints and is contained in any other disjunctive\u000adatabase with the same set of minimal models. We propose an algorithm for\u000acomputing the canonical disjunctive database. Finally, we study the size of the\u000acanonical disjunctive database in the presence of functional dependencies for\u000aboth repairs and cardinality-based repairs.

VIn the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic\u000atransformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions. While the\u000abenefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks\u000ato our society. After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated. Modern information and\u000acommunication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and\u000astrategic benefits. The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous\u000adecision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to\u000abe vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable\u000asocieties, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.

VThis paper examines the use of scientometric overlay mapping as a tool of\u000a'strategic intelligence' to aid the governance of emerging technologies. We\u000adevelop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and\u000aassociated perspectives on technological emergence across the geographical,\u000asocial, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyse (with\u000apublication and patent data) three case-studies of emerging technologies in the\u000amedical domain. These are: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)\u000atesting technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase\u000a(TPMT) genetic testing. Given the flexibility (i.e. adaptability to different\u000asources of data) and granularity (i.e. applicability across multiple levels of\u000adata aggregation) of overlay mapping techniques, we argue that these techniques\u000acan favour the integration and comparison of results from different contexts\u000aand cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a 'distributed'\u000astrategic intelligence for analysts and decision-makers.

We summarize three\u000adifferent Gr\u005c"obner bases implementations: shared memory parallel, pure\u000adistributed memory parallel and distributed memory combined with shared memory\u000aparallelism. The last algorithm, called distributed hybrid, uses only one\u000acontrol communication channel between the master node and the worker nodes and\u000akeeps polynomials in shared memory on a node. The polynomials are transported\u000aasynchronous to the control-flow of the algorithm in a separate distributed\u000adata structure. The implementation is generic and works for all implemented\u000a(exact) fields. We present new performance measurements and discuss the\u000aperformance of the algorithms.

VCurrent security model in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\u000apredominantly use symmetric key cryptography. The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\u000asymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\u000aadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VNowadays, graph databases are employed when relationships between entities\u000aare in the scope of database queries to avoid performance-critical join\u000aoperations of relational databases. Graph queries are used to query and modify\u000agraphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching\u000athat is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be\u000aemployed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern\u000amatches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query\u000aperformance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with\u000athe graphs stored in the graph database.\u000a  In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as\u000atechnique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental\u000amaintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively\u000aand declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our\u000amaintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the\u000agraph database increases. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our approach\u000acan outperform existing approaches for the incremental maintenance of graph\u000aquery results.

VEffective emergency and natural disaster management depend on the efficient\u000amission-critical voice and data communication between first responders and\u000avictims. Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband technology used\u000afor critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.\u000aRecently Long Term Evolution (LTE) emerged as a broadband communication\u000atechnology that has a potential to transform the capabilities of public safety\u000atechnologies by providing broadband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical voice and\u000adata support. For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a\u000anationwide coast-to-coast public safety network based of LTE broadband\u000atechnology. This paper presents a comparative survey of legacy and the\u000aLTE-based public safety networks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE convergence as\u000awell as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A simulation study of LMRS and\u000aLTE band class 14 technologies is provided using the NS-3 open source tool. An\u000aexperimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class 14 is also conducted using\u000asoftware-defined radio, to enhance the understanding of the public safety\u000asystems. Finally, emerging technologies that may have strong potential for use\u000ain public safety networks are reviewed.

VThe importance of security in database research has greatly increased over\u000athe years as most of critical functionality of the business and military\u000aenterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information\u000asystem and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on\u000aphysical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be\u000acompromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading\u000aavailability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology\u000aenvironment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database\u000aresearch community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to\u000athe database security. The database research community has thoughts about these\u000aissues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will\u000aexamine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the\u000aadaption of the research to the changing environment.

Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VWe introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological\u000adevelopments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for\u000athe collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different\u000atechnologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to\u000athe difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when\u000atechnologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and\u000aproviders of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading\u000ato microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and\u000acomputer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of\u000adifferent technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the\u000aspreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of\u000athe system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced\u000atechnologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.\u000aWe show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with\u000aa power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the\u000aspreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order\u000astatistics.

VThere is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel\u000atechnologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of\u000astudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\u000aconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\u000adesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\u000aaims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\u000alinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\u000aoperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\u000acombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\u000a'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\u000aissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\u000aattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\u000aradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\u000aimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\u000aemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\u000aattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\u000ain, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\u000astudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\u000acitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\u000aand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\u000aattributes of emergence.
