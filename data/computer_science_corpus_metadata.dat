VThis article is a brief guide to the field of algorithmic information theory\u000a(AIT), its underlying philosophy, and the most important concepts. AIT arises\u000aby mixing information theory and computation theory to obtain an objective and\u000aabsolute notion of information in an individual object, and in so doing gives\u000arise to an objective and robust notion of randomness of individual objects.\u000aThis is in contrast to classical information theory that is based on random\u000avariables and communication, and has no bearing on information and randomness\u000aof individual objects. After a brief overview, the major subfields,\u000aapplications, history, and a map of the field are presented.

VNetwork Function Virtualization based on FPGAs:A Framework for\u000a  all-Programmable network devices
p62
sS'summary'
p63
VNetwork Function Virtualization (NFV) refers to the use of commodity hardware\u000aresources as the basic platform to perform specialized network functions as\u000aopposed to specialized hardware devices. Currently, NFV is mainly implemented\u000abased on general purpose processors, or general purpose network processors. In\u000athis paper we propose the use of FPGAs as an ideal platform for NFV that can be\u000aused to provide both the flexibility of virtualizations and the high\u000aperformance of the specialized hardware. We present the early attempts of using\u000aFPGAs dynamic reconfiguration in network processing applications to provide\u000aflexible network functions and we present the opportunities for an FPGA-based\u000aNFV platform.

VAutomatic performance debugging of parallel applications usually involves two\u000asteps: automatic detection of performance bottlenecks and uncovering their root\u000acauses for performance optimization. Previous work fails to resolve this\u000achallenging issue in several ways: first, several previous efforts automate\u000aanalysis processes, but present the results in a confined way that only\u000aidentifies performance problems with apriori knowledge; second, several tools\u000atake exploratory or confirmatory data analysis to automatically discover\u000arelevant performance data relationships. However, these efforts do not focus on\u000alocating performance bottlenecks or uncovering their root causes. In this\u000apaper, we design and implement an innovative system, AutoAnalyzer, to\u000aautomatically debug the performance problems of single program multi-data\u000a(SPMD) parallel programs. Our system is unique in terms of two dimensions:\u000afirst, without any apriori knowledge, we automatically locate bottlenecks and\u000auncover their root causes for performance optimization; second, our method is\u000alightweight in terms of size of collected and analyzed performance data. Our\u000acontribution is three-fold. First, we propose a set of simple performance\u000ametrics to represent behavior of different processes of parallel programs, and\u000apresent two effective clustering and searching algorithms to locate\u000abottlenecks. Second, we propose to use the rough set algorithm to automatically\u000auncover the root causes of bottlenecks. Third, we design and implement the\u000aAutoAnalyzer system, and use two production applications to verify the\u000aeffectiveness and correctness of our methods. According to the analysis results\u000aof AutoAnalyzer, we optimize two parallel programs with performance\u000aimprovements by minimally 20% and maximally 170%.

VThe goals of this research were to (1) determine if there is agreement both\u000aamongst viewers, and between viewers and the performer, about the extent to\u000awhich performances are authentic, and (2) ascertain whether or not performers\u000aand/or viewers can distinguish between authenticity and skill. An authentic\u000aperformance is one that is natural or genuine, while an inauthentic performance\u000afeels faked, forced, or imitative. Study participants were asked to rate the\u000aauthenticity and skill level of a series of videotaped performances by dancers\u000aand stand-up comedians. Performers also rated their own performances.\u000aAuthenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated.\u000aRatings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A\u000ahigher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of\u000aperformances for viewers than for performers suggests that viewers make less of\u000aa distinction between authenticity and skill than performers. The relationship\u000abetween authenticity and creativity is discussed.

VOn the Pragmatic Design of Literature Studies in Software Engineering:\u000a  An Experience-based Guideline
p214
sg175
VSystematic literature studies have received much attention in empirical\u000asoftware engineering in recent years. They have become a powerful tool to\u000acollect and structure reported knowledge in a systematic and reproducible way.\u000aWe distinguish systematic literature reviews to systematically analyze reported\u000aevidence in depth, and systematic mapping studies to structure a field of\u000ainterest in a broader, usually quantified manner. Due to the rapidly increasing\u000abody of knowledge in software engineering, researchers who want to capture the\u000apublished work in a domain often face an extensive amount of publications,\u000awhich need to be screened, rated for relevance, classified, and eventually\u000aanalyzed. Although there are several guidelines to conduct literature studies,\u000athey do not yet help researchers coping with the specific difficulties\u000aencountered in the practical application of these guidelines. In this article,\u000awe present an experience-based guideline to aid researchers in designing\u000asystematic literature studies with special emphasis on the data collection and\u000aselection procedures. Our guideline aims at providing a blueprint for a\u000apractical and pragmatic path through the plethora of currently available\u000apractices and deliverables capturing the dependencies among the single steps.\u000aThe guideline emerges from various mapping studies and literature reviews\u000aconducted by the authors and provides recommendations for the general study\u000adesign, data collection, and study selection procedures. Finally, we share our\u000aexperiences and lessons learned in applying the different practices of the\u000aproposed guideline.

VOn the Complexity of Computing Two Nonlinearity Measures
p255
sg31
VWe study the computational complexity of two Boolean nonlinearity measures:\u000athe nonlinearity and the multiplicative complexity. We show that if one-way\u000afunctions exist, no algorithm can compute the multiplicative complexity in time\u000a$2^{O(n)}$ given the truth table of length $2^n$, in fact under the same\u000aassumption it is impossible to approximate the multiplicative complexity within\u000aa factor of $(2-\u005cepsilon)^{n/2}$. When given a circuit, the problem of\u000adetermining the multiplicative complexity is in the second level of the\u000apolynomial hierarchy. For nonlinearity, we show that it is #P hard to compute\u000agiven a function represented by a circuit.

VLearning Moore Machines from Input-Output Traces
p260
sg55
VThe problem of learning automata from example traces (but no equivalence or\u000amembership queries) is fundamental in automata learning theory and practice. In\u000athis paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and\u000aoutputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for\u000asolving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of\u000ainput-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the\u000amachine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known\u000aRPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a\u000aMoore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore\u000amachine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the\u000afundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the\u000aalgorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and\u000aseveral notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with\u000aOSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find\u000athat OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a\u000acharacteristic sample.

VEvolutionary Artificial Neural Network Based on Chemical Reaction\u000a  Optimization
p265
sg84
VEvolutionary algorithms (EAs) are very popular tools to design and evolve\u000aartificial neural networks (ANNs), especially to train them. These methods have\u000aadvantages over the conventional backpropagation (BP) method because of their\u000alow computational requirement when searching in a large solution space. In this\u000apaper, we employ Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO), a newly developed global\u000aoptimization method, to replace BP in training neural networks. CRO is a\u000apopulation-based metaheuristics mimicking the transition of molecules and their\u000ainteractions in a chemical reaction. Simulation results show that CRO\u000aoutperforms many EA strategies commonly used to train neural networks.

VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

VA New Email Retrieval Ranking Approach
p290
sS'summary'
p291
VEmail Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user\u000aretrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query. Up to our knowledge,\u000aexisting email retrieval ranking approaches sort the retrieved emails based on\u000asome heuristic rules, which are either search clues or some predefined user\u000acriteria rooted in email fields. Unfortunately, the user usually does not know\u000athe effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper\u000apresents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It\u000aranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial\u000aemail fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an\u000aarchitecture to allow every user in a network/group of users to be able, if\u000apermissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in\u000ahis submitted query words. The experimental evaluation on Enron corpus prove\u000athat our approach outperforms known email retrieval ranking approaches.

VWe introduce an application of a mobile transient network architecture on top\u000aof the current Internet. This paper is an application extension to a conceptual\u000amobile network architecture. It attempts to specifically reinforce some of the\u000apowerful notions exposed by the architecture from an application perspective.\u000aOf these notions, we explore the network expansion layer, an overlay of\u000acomponents and services, that enables a persistent identification network and\u000aother required services. The overlay abstraction introduces several benefits of\u000awhich mobility and communication across heterogenous network structures are of\u000ainterest to this paper. We present implementations of several components and\u000aprotocols including gateways, Agents and the Open Device Access Protocol. Our\u000apresent identification network implementation exploits the current\u000aimplementation of the Handle System through the use of distributed, global and\u000apersistent identifiers called handles. Handles are used to identify and locate\u000adevices and services abstracting any physical location or network association\u000afrom the communicating ends. A communication framework is finally demonstrated\u000athat would allow for mobile devices on the public Internet to have persistent\u000aidentifiers and thus be persistently accessible either directly or indirectly.\u000aThis application expands IP inter-operability beyond its current boundaries.

VThis paper explores the notion of approximate data structures, which return\u000aapproximately correct answers to queries, but run faster than their exact\u000acounterparts. The paper describes approximate variants of the van Emde Boas\u000adata structure, which support the same dynamic operations as the standard van\u000aEmde Boas data structure (min, max, successor, predecessor, and existence\u000aqueries, as well as insertion and deletion), except that answers to queries are\u000aapproximate. The variants support all operations in constant time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polylog(n), and in O(loglogn) time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polynomial(n), for n elements in the data\u000astructure.\u000a  Applications described include Prim's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm,\u000aDijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm, and an on-line variant of\u000aGraham's convex hull algorithm. To obtain output which approximates the desired\u000aoutput with the performance guarantee tending to 1, Prim's algorithm requires\u000aonly linear time, Dijkstra's algorithm requires O(mloglogn) time, and the\u000aon-line variant of Graham's algorithm requires constant amortized time per\u000aoperation.

The obverse side of\u000athis exponential nature of quantum information is that the computational\u000acomplexity of implementing unconditionally reliable quantum gates is also\u000aexponential.

VBibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval\u000aprocesses in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for\u000ausers. In this workshop we will explore how statistical modelling of\u000ascholarship, such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of coauthorship network,\u000acan improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large,\u000across-domain collections. This workshop aims to raise awareness of the missing\u000alink between information retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics/scientometrics and to\u000acreate a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services\u000ainto retrieval at the digital library interface.

VInformation is the basic concept of information theory. However, there is no\u000adefinition of this concept that can encompass all uses of the term information\u000ain information theories and beyond. Many question a possibility of such a\u000adefinition. However, foundations of information theory developed in the context\u000aof the general theory of information made it possible to build such a relevant\u000aand at the same time, encompassing definition. Foundations of information\u000atheory are built in a form of ontological principles, which reflect basic\u000afeatures of information and information processes.

VGoogle Scholar and the gray literature: A reply to Bonato's review
p463
sg175
VRecently, a review concluded that Google Scholar (GS) is not a suitable\u000asource of information "for identifying recent conference papers or other gray\u000aliterature publications". The goal of this letter is to demonstrate that GS can\u000abe an effective tool to search and find gray literature, as long as appropriate\u000asearch strategies are used. To do this, we took as examples the same two case\u000astudies used by the original review, describing first how GS processes\u000aoriginal's search strategies, then proposing alternative search strategies, and\u000afinally generalizing each case study to compose a general search procedure\u000aaimed at finding gray literature in Google Scholar for two wide selected case\u000astudies: a) all contributions belonging to a congress (the ASCO Annual\u000aMeeting); and b) indexed guidelines as well as gray literature within medical\u000ainstitutions (National Institutes of Health) and governmental agencies (U.S.\u000aDepartment of Health & Human Services). The results confirm that original\u000asearch strategies were undertrained offering misleading results and erroneous\u000aconclusions. Google Scholar lacks many of the advanced search features\u000aavailable in other bibliographic databases (such as Pubmed), however, it is one\u000athing to have a friendly search experience, and quite another to find gray\u000aliterature. We finally conclude that Google Scholar is a powerful tool for\u000asearching gray literature, as long as the users are familiar with all the\u000apossibilities it offers as a search engine. Poorly formulated searches will\u000aundoubtedly return misleading results.

VAccording to Kim, Peris and Song, a continuous linear operator $T$ on a\u000acomplex Banach space $X$ is called {\u005cit numerically hypercyclic} if the\u000anumerical orbit $\u005c{f(T^nx):n\u005cin\u005cN\u005c}$ is dense in $\u005cC$ for some $x\u005cin X$ and\u000a$f\u005cin X^*$ satisfying $\u005c|x\u005c|=\u005c|f\u005c|=f(x)=1$. They have characterized numerically\u000ahypercyclic weighted shifts and provided an example of a numerically\u000ahypercyclic operator on $\u005cC^2$.\u000a  We answer two questions of Kim, Peris and Song. Namely, we construct a\u000anumerically hypercyclic operator, whose square is not numerically hypercyclic\u000aas well as an operator which is not numerically hypercyclic but has two\u000anumerical orbits whose union is dense in $\u005cC$. We characterize numerically\u000ahypercyclic operators on $\u005cC^2$ as well as the operators similar to a\u000anumerically hypercyclic one and those operators whose conjugacy class consists\u000aentirely of numerically hypercyclic operators. We describe in spectral terms\u000athe operator norm closure of the set of numerically hypercyclic operators on a\u000areflexive Banach space. Finally, we provide criteria for numeric hypercyclicity\u000aand decide upon the numerical hypercyclicity of operators from various classes.

VThis paper proposes a scalable and resilient real-time multi-party\u000acommunication architecture for the delivery of mixed media streams, for which\u000acontent centric networking, with its intelligent network layer, is chosen for\u000aimplementation to address the shortcomings of the current IP-based Internet\u000aarchitecture. Content centric networking (CCN) represents one of the major\u000aproposals targeting future Internet architecture, and is typically optimized\u000afor non-realtime content delivery. Proposed research in this paper addresses\u000athe architectural challenges for large-scale deployment of CCN to serve\u000areal-time applications from the perspective of a multi-party video conferencing\u000aframework, with the necessary architectural components to support application-\u000aand system-level objectives, in regards to quality of experience, resource\u000autilization, and scalability. We present an in-depth analysis of the proposed\u000aarchitecture by first providing an analytical driven study for the system, and\u000athen demonstrating its performance by emulating the architecture over a\u000atest-bed with a large number of participants involved in many-to-many\u000acommunication sessions. The results suggest that the proposed architecture can\u000ascale well above 50 participants without incurring significant penalty in\u000asignaling, communication, and computing overheads, with capability to support\u000a100 or more participants.

Typically the interpretation can\u000atake place by browsing either the software model or the performance model.

We apply both approaches to the same example in order to\u000aillustrate the differences in the obtained performance results.

VEffective emergency and natural disaster management depend on the efficient\u000amission-critical voice and data communication between first responders and\u000avictims. Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband technology used\u000afor critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.\u000aRecently Long Term Evolution (LTE) emerged as a broadband communication\u000atechnology that has a potential to transform the capabilities of public safety\u000atechnologies by providing broadband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical voice and\u000adata support. For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a\u000anationwide coast-to-coast public safety network based of LTE broadband\u000atechnology. This paper presents a comparative survey of legacy and the\u000aLTE-based public safety networks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE convergence as\u000awell as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A simulation study of LMRS and\u000aLTE band class 14 technologies is provided using the NS-3 open source tool. An\u000aexperimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class 14 is also conducted using\u000asoftware-defined radio, to enhance the understanding of the public safety\u000asystems. Finally, emerging technologies that may have strong potential for use\u000ain public safety networks are reviewed.

VFrame matroids and lifted-graphic matroids are two interesting\u000ageneralizations of graphic matroids. Here we introduce a new generalization,\u000a{\u005cem quasi-graphic matroids}, that unifies these two existing classes. Unlike\u000aframe matroids and lifted-graphic matroids, it is easy to certify that a\u000amatroid is quasi-graphic. The main result of the paper is that every\u000a$3$-connected representable quasi-graphic matroid is either a lifted-graphic\u000amatroid or a frame matroid.

VStandard OCR is a well-researched topic of computer vision and can be\u000aconsidered solved for machine-printed text. However, when applied to\u000aunconstrained images, the recognition rates drop drastically. Therefore, the\u000aemployment of object recognition-based techniques has become state of the art\u000ain scene text recognition applications. This paper presents a scene text\u000arecognition method tailored to ancient coin legends and compares the results\u000aachieved in character and word recognition experiments to a standard OCR\u000aengine. The conducted experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the\u000astandard OCR engine on a set of 180 cropped coin legend words.

VDevelopment of Tool for Mapping Conventional Circuit to Reversible Logic
p656
sg76
VIn the last decades, great achievements have been made in the development of\u000acomputing machines. However, due to exponential growth of transistor density\u000aand in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers\u000aexpect that "Conventional Technologies" like Complementary Metal-Oxide\u000aSemiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the\u000aneeds for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are\u000aneeded. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of\u000aconventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising\u000asolution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high\u000aspeed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the\u000ainput data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new\u000atechnology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the\u000aacceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side\u000atransformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge\u000ato designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible\u000acircuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track.\u000aIn this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on binary logic system\u000ahas been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in binary logic\u000asystem and output as reversible circuit. Entire environment is GUI based and\u000aeasy to learn user friendly. This tool offers editing, storage and conversion\u000ainto reversible facility.

Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to\u000aenhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer\u000avalue-added effects for users. In this workshop we will explore how statistical\u000amodelling of scholarship, such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of\u000aco-authorship network, can improve retrieval services for specific communities,\u000aas well as for large, cross-domain collections.

Our interests include information retrieval, information\u000aseeking, science modelling, network analysis, and digital libraries. The goal\u000ais to apply insights from bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics to\u000aconcrete practical problems of information retrieval and browsing.

VWe consider the task of estimating a Gaussian graphical model in the\u000ahigh-dimensional setting. The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the\u000aGaussian log likelihood subject to an l1 penalty, is a well-studied approach\u000afor this task. We begin by introducing a surprising connection between the\u000agraphical lasso and hierarchical clustering: the graphical lasso in effect\u000aperforms a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical\u000aclustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected\u000acomponents, and then (2) an l1-penalized log likelihood is maximized on the\u000asubset of variables within each connected component. In other words, the\u000agraphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network\u000avia single linkage clustering. Unfortunately, single linkage clustering is\u000aknown to perform poorly in certain settings. Therefore, we propose the cluster\u000agraphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to\u000asingle linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the\u000asubset of variables within each cluster. We establish model selection\u000aconsistency for this technique, and demonstrate its improved performance\u000arelative to the graphical lasso in a simulation study, as well as in\u000aapplications to an equities data set, a university webpage data set, and a gene\u000aexpression data set.

VA Resource Allocation Mechanism for Video Mixing as a Cloud Computing\u000a  Service in Multimedia Conferencing Applications
p703

p704
VMultimedia conferencing is the conversational exchange of multimedia content\u000abetween multiple parties. It has a wide range of applications (e.g. Massively\u000aMultiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and distance learning). Many multimedia\u000aconferencing applications use video extensively, thus video mixing in\u000aconferencing settings is of critical importance. Cloud computing is a\u000atechnology that can solve the scalability issue in multimedia conferencing,\u000awhile bringing other benefits, such as, elasticity, efficient use of resources,\u000arapid development, and introduction of new applications. However, proposed\u000acloud-based multimedia conferencing approaches so far have several deficiencies\u000awhen it comes to efficient resource usage while meeting Quality of Service\u000a(QoS) requirements. We propose a solution to optimize resource allocation for\u000acloud-based video mixing service in multimedia conferencing applications, which\u000acan support scalability in terms of number of users, while guaranteeing QoS. We\u000aformulate the resource allocation problem mathematically as an Integer Linear\u000aProgramming (ILP) problem and design a heuristic for it. Simulation results\u000ashow that our resource allocation model can support more participants compared\u000ato the state-of-the-art, while honoring QoS, with respect to end-to-end delay.

VNetwork Coding Meets Multimedia: a Review
p719
sg704
VWhile every network node only relays messages in a traditional communication\u000asystem, the recent network coding (NC) paradigm proposes to implement simple\u000ain-network processing with packet combinations in the nodes. NC extends the\u000aconcept of "encoding" a message beyond source coding (for compression) and\u000achannel coding (for protection against errors and losses). It has been shown to\u000aincrease network throughput compared to traditional networks implementation, to\u000areduce delay and to provide robustness to transmission errors and network\u000adynamics. These features are so appealing for multimedia applications that they\u000ahave spurred a large research effort towards the development of\u000amultimedia-specific NC techniques. This paper reviews the recent work in NC for\u000amultimedia applications and focuses on the techniques that fill the gap between\u000aNC theory and practical applications. It outlines the benefits of NC and\u000apresents the open challenges in this area. The paper initially focuses on\u000amultimedia-specific aspects of network coding, in particular delay, in-network\u000aerror control, and media-specific error control. These aspects permit to handle\u000avarying network conditions as well as client heterogeneity, which are critical\u000ato the design and deployment of multimedia systems. After introducing these\u000ageneral concepts, the paper reviews in detail two applications that lend\u000athemselves naturally to NC via the cooperation and broadcast models, namely\u000apeer-to-peer multimedia streaming and wireless networking.

VThe current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which\u000adisrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the prevailing view of\u000asociety is based on the ontological primacy of stable hierarchical structures,\u000awhich is no longer adequate.\u000a  We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing\u000asocial system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it\u000afollows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of\u000aindividuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive\u000aprocesses in the evolution of a system.\u000a  The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system -- an ecology of\u000ainteracting social subsystems -- each of which is also a living cognitive\u000asystem. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social\u000asystems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The\u000aLiving Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics\u000aand the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of\u000aInformation and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work.\u000a  We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research -- distributed\u000asocial governance -- which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on\u000astable structures within global society.

VLinear Software Models: Key Ideas

VLinear Software Models is a systematic effort to formulate a theory of\u000asoftware systems neatly based upon standard mathematics, viz. linear algebra.\u000aIt has appeared in a series of papers dealing with various aspects of the\u000atheory. But one was lacking a single source for its key ideas. This paper\u000aconcisely distills foundational ideas and results obtained within Linear\u000aSoftware Models. First and foremost we claim that one must have a deep\u000acomprehension of the theory of software - the aim of this effort - before\u000aembarking into theory and practice of software engineering. The Modularity\u000aMatrix is the central algebraic structure of the software theory: it is the\u000asource of quantitative modularity criteria; it displays high cohesion, i.e.\u000ahigh sparsity; a Standard Modularity Matrix is defined - square and\u000ablock-diagonal - enabling designs comparison for any software systems in a\u000aSoftware Design Laboratory. It triggers formulation of novel open questions\u000awaiting for resolution.

In addition, an\u000aanalogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is\u000aelaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction\u000acomplexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal\u000aphysical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding''\u000abound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing\u000amachine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it\u000ais proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type\u000aof computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic\u000ainformation complexity).

VWe show that the celebrated 1956 Lax-Richtmyer linear theorem in Numerical\u000aAnalysis - often called the Fundamental Theorem of Numerical Analysis - is in\u000afact wrong. Here "wrong" does not mean that its statement is false\u000amathematically, but that it has a limited practical relevance as it\u000amisrepresents what actually goes on in the numerical analysis of partial\u000adifferential equations. Namely, the assumptions used in that theorem are\u000aexcessive to the extent of being unrealistic from practical point of view. The\u000atwo facts which the mentioned theorem gets wrong from practical point of view\u000aare : - the relationship between the convergence and stability of numerical\u000amethods for linear PDEs, - the effect of the propagation of round-off errors in\u000asuch numerical methods. The mentioned theorem leads to a result for PDEs which\u000ais unrealistically better than the well known best possible similar result in\u000athe numerical analysis of ODEs. Strangely enough, this fact seems not to be\u000aknown well enough in the literature. Once one becomes aware of the above, new\u000aavenues of both practical and theoretical interest can open up in the numerical\u000aanalysis of PDEs.

VReaction automata are a formal model that has been introduced to investigate\u000athe computing powers of interactive behaviors of biochemical reactions([14]).\u000aReaction automata are language acceptors with multiset rewriting mechanism\u000awhose basic frameworks are based on reaction systems introduced in [4]. In this\u000apaper we continue the investigation of reaction automata with a focus on the\u000aformal language theoretic properties of subclasses of reaction automata, called\u000alinearbounded reaction automata (LRAs) and exponentially-bounded reaction\u000aautomata (ERAs). Besides LRAs, we newly introduce an extended model (denoted by\u000alambda-LRAs) by allowing lambda-moves in the accepting process of reaction, and\u000ainvestigate the closure properties of language classes accepted by both LRAs\u000aand lambda-LRAs. Further, we establish new relationships of language classes\u000aaccepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results\u000ainclude the following : (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs\u000aforms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively\u000aenumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language\u000aaccepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides\u000awith the class of context-sensitive languages.

In our study, we examine how sets of constraints\u000ainfluence the difficulty of obtaining close to optimal solutions. Using a\u000amulti-objective approach, we evolve constrained continuous problems having a\u000aset of linear and/or quadratic constraints where the different evolutionary\u000aapproaches show a significant difference in performance. Afterwards, we discuss\u000athe features of the constraints that exhibit a difference in performance of the\u000adifferent evolutionary approaches under consideration.

VEvolutionary Image Transition Based on Theoretical Insights of Random\u000a  Processes

VEvolutionary algorithms have been widely studied from a theoretical\u000aperspective. In particular, the area of runtime analysis has contributed\u000asignificantly to a theoretical understanding and provided insights into the\u000aworking behaviour of these algorithms. We study how these insights into\u000aevolutionary processes can be used for evolutionary art. We introduce the\u000anotion of evolutionary image transition which transfers a given starting image\u000ainto a target image through an evolutionary process. Combining standard\u000amutation effects known from the optimization of the classical benchmark\u000afunction OneMax and different variants of random walks, we present ways of\u000aperforming evolutionary image transition with different artistic effects.

VDespite its great importance, modern network infrastructure is remarkable for\u000athe lack of rigor in its engineering. The Internet which began as a research\u000aexperiment was never designed to handle the users and applications it hosts\u000atoday. The lack of formalization of the Internet architecture meant limited\u000aabstractions and modularity, especially for the control and management planes,\u000athus requiring for every new need a new protocol built from scratch. This led\u000ato an unwieldy ossified Internet architecture resistant to any attempts at\u000aformal verification, and an Internet culture where expediency and pragmatism\u000aare favored over formal correctness. Fortunately, recent work in the space of\u000aclean slate Internet design---especially, the software defined networking (SDN)\u000aparadigm---offers the Internet community another chance to develop the right\u000akind of architecture and abstractions. This has also led to a great resurgence\u000ain interest of applying formal methods to specification, verification, and\u000asynthesis of networking protocols and applications. In this paper, we present a\u000aself-contained tutorial of the formidable amount of work that has been done in\u000aformal methods, and present a survey of its applications to networking.

p914
sg352
VThis paper, the first step to connect relational databases with systems\u000aconsequence (Kent: "System Consequence" 2009), is concerned with the semantics\u000aof relational databases. It aims to to study system consequence in the\u000alogical/semantic system of relational databases. The paper, which was inspired\u000aby and which extends a recent set of papers on the theory of relational\u000adatabase systems (Spivak: "Functorial Data Migration" 2012), is linked with\u000awork on the Information Flow Framework (IFF) [http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/]\u000aconnected with the ontology standards effort (SUO), since relational databases\u000anaturally embed into first order logic. The database semantics discussed here\u000ais concerned with the conceptual level of database architecture. We offer both\u000aan intuitive and technical discussion. Corresponding to the notions of primary\u000aand foreign keys, relational database semantics takes two forms: a\u000adistinguished form where entities are distinguished from relations, and a\u000aunified form where relations and entities coincide. The distinguished form\u000acorresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Simplicial databases"\u000a2009)[arXiv:0904.2012]. The unified form, a special case of the distinguished\u000aform, corresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Functorial Data\u000aMigration" 2012). A later paper will discuss various formalisms of relational\u000adatabases, such as relational algebra and first order logic, and will complete\u000athe description of the relational database logical environment.

VA large number of computational scientific research projects make use of open\u000asource software packages. However, the development process of such tools\u000afrequently differs from conventional software development; partly because of\u000athe nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fully\u000aunderstood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried out\u000aby scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices of\u000asoftware engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressure\u000ato publish scientific results and that credit for software development is\u000alimited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering like\u000amodular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and software\u000aintegration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to be\u000adisregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovative\u000adevelopments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to master\u000adevelopment for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions. The growing\u000acomplexity of research, however, requires suitable and maintainable\u000acomputational tools, resulting in a widening gap between the potential users\u000a(often growing in number) and contributors to the development of such a\u000apackage.

VOver the past three decades, since its invention, the Internet has evolved in\u000aboth its sheer volume and usage. The Internet's core protocol, Internet\u000aProtocol (IP), has proven its usability and effectiveness to support a\u000acommunication network. However, current Internet usage requires more than a\u000acommunication network due to a shift in the nature of Internet applications\u000afrom simple email application to large content producers such as NetFlix,\u000aGoogle, Amazon, etc. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the few\u000ainitiatives/projects addressing the shortcomings of the current Internet\u000aarchitecture and intends to move the Internet toward a content distribution\u000aarchitecture. In this paper, we conduct a brief survey of security\u000atopics/problems inherent to the NDN architecture. Specifically, we describe\u000acurrent known problems and propose solutions to major security problems.

VA survey on data and transaction management in mobile databases

VThe popularity of the Mobile Database is increasing day by day as people need\u000ainformation even on the move in the fast changing world. This database\u000atechnology permits employees using mobile devices to connect to their corporate\u000anetworks, hoard the needed data, work in the disconnected mode and reconnect to\u000athe network to synchronize with the corporate database. In this scenario, the\u000adata is being moved closer to the applications in order to improve the\u000aperformance and autonomy. This leads to many interesting problems in mobile\u000adatabase research and Mobile Database has become a fertile land for many\u000aresearchers. In this paper a survey is presented on data and Transaction\u000amanagement in Mobile Databases from the year 2000 onwards. The survey focuses\u000aon the complete study on the various types of Architectures used in Mobile\u000adatabases and Mobile Transaction Models. It also addresses the data management\u000aissues namely Replication and Caching strategies and the transaction management\u000afunctionalities such as Concurrency Control and Commit protocols,\u000aSynchronization, Query Processing, Recovery and Security. It also provides\u000aResearch Directions in Mobile databases.

Additionally, simple criteria for\u000arecognition success are derived from a lower bound on the basins of attraction.

VThe field of digital libraries (DLs) coalesced in 1994: the first digital\u000alibrary conferences were held that year, awareness of the World Wide Web was\u000aaccelerating, and the National Science Foundation awarded $24 Million (U.S.)\u000afor the Digital Library Initiative (DLI). In this paper we examine the state of\u000athe DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to\u000athe co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital\u000alibrary conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract\u000aseveral established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define\u000a$AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the\u000anetwork. The results are validated against conference program committee members\u000ain the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and\u000aAuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also\u000ainvestigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint\u000aConference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).

VEvolutionary processes proved very useful for solving optimization problems.\u000aIn this work, we build a formalization of the notion of cooperation and\u000acompetition of multiple systems working toward a common optimization goal of\u000athe population using evolutionary computation techniques. It is justified that\u000aevolutionary algorithms are more expressive than conventional recursive\u000aalgorithms. Three subclasses of evolutionary algorithms are proposed here:\u000abounded finite, unbounded finite and infinite types. Some results on\u000acompleteness, optimality and search decidability for the above classes are\u000apresented. A natural extension of Evolutionary Turing Machine model developed\u000ain this paper allows one to mathematically represent and study properties of\u000acooperation and competition in a population of optimized species.

VThe View-Update Problem for Indefinite Databases
p999
sg352
VThis paper introduces and studies a declarative framework for updating views\u000aover indefinite databases. An indefinite database is a database with null\u000avalues that are represented, following the standard database approach, by a\u000asingle null constant. The paper formalizes views over such databases as\u000aindefinite deductive databases, and defines for them several classes of\u000adatabase repairs that realize view-update requests. Most notable is the class\u000aof constrained repairs. Constrained repairs change the database "minimally" and\u000aavoid making arbitrary commitments. They narrow down the space of alternative\u000aways to fulfill the view-update request to those that are grounded, in a\u000acertain strong sense, in the database, the view and the view-update request.

VMragyati : A System for Keyword-based Searching in Databases
p1009
sg352
VThe web, through many search engine sites, has popularized the keyword-based\u000asearch paradigm, where a user can specify a string of keywords and expect to\u000aretrieve relevant documents, possibly ranked by their relevance to the query.\u000aSince a lot of information is stored in databases (and not as HTML documents),\u000ait is important to provide a similar search paradigm for databases, where users\u000acan query a database without knowing the database schema and database query\u000alanguages such as SQL. In this paper, we propose such a database search system,\u000awhich accepts a free-form query as a collection of keywords, translates it into\u000aqueries on the database using the database metadata, and presents query results\u000ain a well-structured and browsable form. Th eysytem maps keywords onto the\u000adatabase schema and uses inter-relationships (i.e., data semantics) among the\u000areferred tables to generate meaningful query results. We also describe our\u000aprototype for database search, called Mragyati. Th eapproach proposed here is\u000ascalable, as it does not build an in-memory graph of the entire database for\u000asearching for relationships among the objects selected by the user's query.

VUndirected graphical models, or Markov networks, are a popular class of\u000astatistical models, used in a wide variety of applications. Popular instances\u000aof this class include Gaussian graphical models and Ising models. In many\u000asettings, however, it might not be clear which subclass of graphical models to\u000ause, particularly for non-Gaussian and non-categorical data. In this paper, we\u000aconsider a general sub-class of graphical models where the node-wise\u000aconditional distributions arise from exponential families. This allows us to\u000aderive multivariate graphical model distributions from univariate exponential\u000afamily distributions, such as the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential\u000adistributions. Our key contributions include a class of M-estimators to fit\u000athese graphical model distributions; and rigorous statistical analysis showing\u000athat these M-estimators recover the true graphical model structure exactly,\u000awith high probability. We provide examples of genomic and proteomic networks\u000alearned via instances of our class of graphical models derived from Poisson and\u000aexponential distributions.

VMany exact and approximate solution methods for Markov Decision Processes\u000a(MDPs) attempt to exploit structure in the problem and are based on\u000afactorization of the value function. Especially multiagent settings, however,\u000aare known to suffer from an exponential increase in value component sizes as\u000ainteractions become denser, meaning that approximation architectures are\u000arestricted in the problem sizes and types they can handle. We present an\u000aapproach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems,\u000aexploiting a property that can be thought of as "anonymous influence" in the\u000afactored MDP. Anonymous influence summarizes joint variable effects efficiently\u000awhenever the explicit representation of variable identity in the problem can be\u000aavoided. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into\u000acomputational efficiencies, both for general variable elimination in a factor\u000agraph but in particular also for the approximate linear programming solution to\u000afactored MDPs. The latter allows to scale linear programming to factored MDPs\u000athat were previously unsolvable. Our results are shown for the control of a\u000astochastic disease process over a densely connected graph with 50 nodes and 25\u000aagents.

We summarize three\u000adifferent Gr\u005c"obner bases implementations: shared memory parallel, pure\u000adistributed memory parallel and distributed memory combined with shared memory\u000aparallelism. The last algorithm, called distributed hybrid, uses only one\u000acontrol communication channel between the master node and the worker nodes and\u000akeeps polynomials in shared memory on a node. The polynomials are transported\u000aasynchronous to the control-flow of the algorithm in a separate distributed\u000adata structure. The implementation is generic and works for all implemented\u000a(exact) fields. We present new performance measurements and discuss the\u000aperformance of the algorithms.

VThe Internet Protocol (IP) is the lifeblood of the modern Internet. Its\u000asimplicity and universality have fueled the unprecedented and lasting global\u000asuccess of the current Internet. Nonetheless, some limitations of IP have been\u000aemerging in recent years. Its original design envisaged supporting perhaps tens\u000aof thousands of static hosts operating in a friendly academic-like setting,\u000amainly in order to facilitate email communication and remote access to scarce\u000acomputing resources. At present IP interconnects billions of static and mobile\u000adevices (ranging from supercomputers to IoT gadgets) with a large and dynamic\u000aset of popular applications. Starting in mid-1990s, the advent of mobility,\u000awirelessness and the web substantially shifted Internet usage and communication\u000aparadigms. This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet\u000aarchitecture and prompted interest in alternative designs.\u000a  The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters\u000aof efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures.\u000aAs a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized "security and privacy by\u000adesign" in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching\u000aand retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this\u000aend, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects\u000awere funded by the NSF in 2010: Nebula, Named-Data Networking (NDN),\u000aMobilityFirst (MF), and Expressive Internet Architecture (XIA). This paper\u000aprovides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy\u000afeatures (and issues) in these NSF-funded Future Internet Architectures. It\u000aalso compares the four candidate designs with the current IP-based architecture\u000aand discusses similarities, differences, and possible improvements.

VVarious XML-based approaches aimed at representing compound digital assets\u000ahave emerged over the last several years. Approaches that are of specific\u000arelevance to the digital library community include the Metadata Encoding and\u000aTransmission Standard (METS), the IMS Content Packaging XML Binding, and the\u000aXML Formatted Data Units (XFDU) developed by CCSDS Panel 2. The MPEG-21 Digital\u000aItem Declaration (MPEG-21 DID) is another standard specifying the\u000arepresentation of digital assets in XML that, so far, has received little\u000aattention in the digital library community. This article gives a brief insight\u000ainto the MPEG-21 standardization effort, highlights the major characteristics\u000aof the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model, and describes the MPEG-21 Digital Item\u000aDeclaration Language (MPEG-21 DIDL), an XML syntax for the representation of\u000adigital assets based on the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model. Also, it briefly\u000ademonstrates the potential relevance of MPEG-21 DID to the digital library\u000acommunity by describing its use in the aDORe repository environment at the\u000aResearch Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for the\u000arepresentation of digital assets.

VThis decade has seen a great deal of progress in the development of\u000ainformation retrieval systems. Unfortunately, we still lack a systematic\u000aunderstanding of the behavior of the systems and their relationship with\u000adocuments. In this paper we present a completely new approach towards the\u000aunderstanding of the information retrieval systems. Recently, it has been\u000aobserved that retrieval systems in TREC 6 show some remarkable patterns in\u000aretrieving relevant documents. Based on the TREC 6 observations, we introduce a\u000ageometric linear model of information retrieval systems. We then apply the\u000amodel to predict the number of relevant documents by the retrieval systems. The\u000amodel is also scalable to a much larger data set. Although the model is\u000adeveloped based on the TREC 6 routing test data, I believe it can be readily\u000aapplicable to other information retrieval systems. In Appendix, we explained a\u000asimple and efficient way of making a better system from the existing systems.

Two cases of this problem arise\u000adepending on the availability of the side information at the encoder. The set\u000aof all feasible rate-distortion-equivocation tuples are characterized for both\u000acases. The difference between the informed and uninformed cases and the\u000aadvantages of encoder side information for enhancing privacy are highlighted\u000afor a binary symmetric source with erasure side information and Hamming\u000adistortion.

VThe ad hoc coordination problem is to design an autonomous agent which is\u000aable to achieve optimal flexibility and efficiency in a multiagent system with\u000ano mechanisms for prior coordination. We conceptualise this problem formally\u000ausing a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the\u000abehaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based\u000aon this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc\u000aCoordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in\u000aa planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal\u000acontrol. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based\u000aforaging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than\u000aseveral alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at\u000aa public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated\u000aPrisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative\u000aalgorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly\u000ahigher welfare and winning rate.

VPart 1 has studied the conversion of observed random process with its hidden\u000ainformation to related dynamic process, applying entropy functional measure\u000a(EF) of the random process and path functional information measure (IPF) of the\u000adynamic conversion process. The variation principle, satisfying the EF-IPF\u000aequivalence along shortest path-trajectory, leads to information dual\u000acomplementary maxmin-minimax law, which creates mechanism of arising\u000ainformation regularities from stochastic process(Lerner 2012). This Part 2\u000astudies mechanism of cooperation of the observed multiple hidden information\u000aprocess, which follows from the law and produces cooperative structures,\u000aconcurrently assembling in hierarchical information network (IN) and generating\u000athe IN digital genetic code. We analyze the interactive information\u000acontributions, information quality, inner time scale, information geometry of\u000athe cooperative structures, evaluate curvature of these geometrical forms and\u000atheir cooperative information complexities. The law information mechanisms\u000aoperate in information observer.

VThis paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we develop a new\u000ainformation theory, in which it is not a coincidence that information and\u000aphysical entropy share the same mathematical formula. It is an adaptation of\u000amind to help search for resources. We then show that psychological patterns\u000aeither reflect the constraints of physical laws or are evolutionary adaptations\u000ato efficiently process information and to increase the chance of survival in\u000athe environment of our evolutionary past. In the second part, we demonstrate\u000athat the new information theory provides the foundation to understand market\u000abehavior. One fundamental result from the information theory is that\u000ainformation is costly. In general, information with higher value is more\u000acostly. Another fundamental result from the information theory is that the\u000aamount of information one can receive is the amount of information generated\u000aminus equivocation. The level of equivocation, which is the measure of\u000ainformation asymmetry, is determined by the correlation between the source of\u000ainformation and the receiver of information. In general, how much information\u000aone can receive depends on the background knowledge of the receiver. The\u000adifference in cost different investors are willing to pay for information and\u000athe difference in background knowledge about a particular information causes\u000athe heterogeneity in information processing by the investment public, which is\u000athe main reason of the price and volume patterns observed in the market. Many\u000aassumptions in some of the recent models on behavioral finance can be derived\u000anaturally from this theory.

VFrom the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for\u000athe activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning\u000aapplications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental\u000atheoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is\u000aconstrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the\u000aTuring Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe\u000aitself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the\u000apresent paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy\u000apoint of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination\u000aof learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying\u000aagent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the\u000aproblem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in\u000areality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for\u000alearning Turing machines.

VWe show that there are Turing complete computably enumerable sets of\u000aarbitrarily low non-trivial initial segment prefix-free complexity. In\u000aparticular, given any computably enumerable set $A$ with non-trivial\u000aprefix-free initial segment complexity, there exists a Turing complete\u000acomputably enumerable set $B$ with complexity strictly less than the complexity\u000aof $A$. On the other hand it is known that sets with trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity are not Turing complete.\u000a  Moreover we give a generalization of this result for any finite collection of\u000acomputably enumerable sets $A_i, i<k$ with non-trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity. An application of this gives a negative answer to a\u000aquestion from \u005ccite[Section 11.12]{rodenisbook} and \u005ccite{MRmerstcdhdtd} which\u000aasked for minimal pairs in the structure of the c.e.\u005c reals ordered by their\u000ainitial segment prefix-free complexity.\u000a  Further consequences concern various notions of degrees of randomness. For\u000aexample, the Solovay degrees and the $K$-degrees of computably enumerable reals\u000aand computably enumerable sets are not elementarily equivalent. Also, the\u000adegrees of randomness based on plain and prefix-free complexity are not\u000aelementarily equivalent; the same holds for their $\u005cDelta^0_2$ and $\u005cSigma^0_1$\u000asubstructures.

VMapping Cones are Operator Systems
p1244
sg188
VWe investigate the relationship between mapping cones and matrix ordered\u000a*-vector spaces (i.e., abstract operator systems). We show that to every\u000amapping cone there is an associated operator system on the space of n-by-n\u000acomplex matrices, and furthermore we show that the associated operator system\u000ais unique and has a certain homogeneity property. Conversely, we show that the\u000acone of completely positive maps on any operator system with that homogeneity\u000aproperty is a mapping cone. We also consider several related problems, such as\u000acharacterizing cones that are closed under composition on the right by\u000acompletely positive maps, and cones that are also semigroups, in terms of\u000aoperator systems.

The FFT processor\u000ais simulated using VHDL and the results are validated on a Virtex-6 FPGA. The\u000aproposed architecture outperforms the conventional architecture of a $N$-point\u000aFFT processor in terms of area which is reduced by a factor of $log_N 2$ with\u000anegligible increase in processing time.

VGenerating EPICS IOC Databases from a Relational Database - a Different\u000a  Approach
p1274
sg352
VThe EPICS based control system of the ISAC radioactive beam facility uses the\u000aCapFast schematic editor to construct the IOC function-block databases. This\u000aallows a self-documenting graphical representation of the IOC software using a\u000ahierarchical, object-like software structure with reusable components. On the\u000aother hand, the control system is quarterbacked by a relational database, which\u000acontains all device information. Using database reports and Perl scripts, a\u000adevice instantiation method was developed which generates top-level schematic\u000afiles in CapFast format. This method exploits the advantages of device data\u000aentry and reporting using a relational database system while maintaining the\u000agraphical representation of the IOC database.

VModern cyber-physical systems (CPS) have a close inter-dependence between\u000asoftware and physical components. Automotive embedded systems are typical CPS,\u000aas physical chips, sensors and actuators are physical components and software\u000aembedded within are the cyber components. The current stage of embedded systems\u000ais highly complex in architecture design for both software and hardware. It is\u000acommon in industrial practice that high level control algorithm development and\u000alow level code implementation on hardware platforms are developed separately\u000awith limited shared information. However, software code and hardware\u000aarchitecture become closely related with the increasing complexity. Correlated\u000arequirements and dependencies between hardware and software are emerging\u000aproblems of industrial practice. We demonstrate in this paper a method to link\u000amodel based system design with real-time simulations and analysis of the\u000aarchitecture model. This allows hardware software co-design and thus early\u000aselection of hardware architecture.

VThe emerging field of quantum machine learning has the potential to\u000asubstantially aid in the problems and scope of artificial intelligence. This is\u000aonly enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning.\u000aIn this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine\u000alearning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general\u000aand covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised,\u000aunsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in\u000asupervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning\u000ahas received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of\u000aquantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a\u000asystematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that\u000aquadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in\u000aperformance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of\u000alearning problems.

VIn this paper we consider the class of lambda-nondeterministic linear\u000aautomata as a model of the class of linear languages. As usual in other\u000aautomata models, lambda-moves do not increase the acceptance power. The main\u000acontribution of this paper is to introduce the deterministic linear automata\u000aand even linear automata, i.e. the natural restriction of nondeterministic\u000alinear automata for the deterministic and even linear language classes,\u000arespectively. In particular, there are different, but not equivalents,\u000aproposals for the class of "deterministic" linear languages. We proved here\u000athat the class of languages accepted by the deterministic linear automata are\u000anot contained in any of the these classes and in fact they properly contain\u000athese classes. Another, contribution is the generation of an infinite hierarchy\u000aof formal languages, going from the class of languages accepted by\u000adeterministic linear automata and achieved, in the limit, the class of linear\u000alanguages.

VHybrid XML Retrieval: Combining Information Retrieval and a Native XML\u000a  Database
p1412
sg291
VThis paper investigates the impact of three approaches to XML retrieval:\u000ausing Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; using eXist, a native\u000aXML database; and using a hybrid system that takes full article answers from\u000aZettair and uses eXist to extract elements from those articles. For the\u000acontent-only topics, we undertake a preliminary analysis of the INEX 2003\u000arelevance assessments in order to identify the types of highly relevant\u000adocument components. Further analysis identifies two complementary sub-cases of\u000arelevance assessments ("General" and "Specific") and two categories of topics\u000a("Broad" and "Narrow"). We develop a novel retrieval module that for a\u000acontent-only topic utilises the information from the resulting answer list of a\u000anative XML database and dynamically determines the preferable units of\u000aretrieval, which we call "Coherent Retrieval Elements". The results of our\u000aexperiments show that -- when each of the three systems is evaluated against\u000adifferent retrieval scenarios (such as different cases of relevance\u000aassessments, different topic categories and different choices of evaluation\u000ametrics) -- the XML retrieval systems exhibit varying behaviour and the best\u000aperformance can be reached for different values of the retrieval parameters. In\u000athe case of INEX 2003 relevance assessments for the content-only topics, our\u000anewly developed hybrid XML retrieval system is substantially more effective\u000athan either Zettair or eXist, and yields a robust and a very effective XML\u000aretrieval.

VPerformance antipatterns document bad design patterns that have negative\u000ainfluence on system performance. In our previous work we formalized such\u000aantipatterns as logical predicates that predicate on four views: (i) the static\u000aview that captures the software elements (e.g. classes, components) and the\u000astatic relationships among them; (ii) the dynamic view that represents the\u000ainteraction (e.g. messages) that occurs between the software entities elements\u000ato provide the system functionalities; (iii) the deployment view that describes\u000athe hardware elements (e.g. processing nodes) and the mapping of the software\u000aentities onto the hardware platform; (iv) the performance view that collects\u000aspecific performance indices. In this paper we present a lightweight\u000ainfrastructure that is able to detect performance antipatterns at runtime\u000athrough monitoring. The proposed approach precalculates such predicates and\u000aidentifies antipatterns whose static, dynamic and deployment sub-predicates are\u000avalidated by the current system configuration and brings at runtime the\u000averification of performance sub-predicates. The proposed infrastructure\u000aleverages model-driven techniques to generate probes for monitoring the\u000aperformance sub-predicates and detecting antipatterns at runtime.

VDigital multimedia watermarking technology was suggested in the last decade\u000ato embed copyright information in digital objects such images, audio and video.\u000aHowever, the increasing use of relational database systems in many real-life\u000aapplications created an ever increasing need for watermarking database systems.\u000aAs a result, watermarking relational database systems is now merging as a\u000aresearch area that deals with the legal issue of copyright protection of\u000adatabase systems. Approach: In this study, we proposed an efficient database\u000awatermarking algorithm based on inserting binary image watermarks in\u000anon-numeric mutli-word attributes of selected database tuples. Results: The\u000aalgorithm is robust as it resists attempts to remove or degrade the embedded\u000awatermark and it is blind as it does not require the original database in order\u000ato extract the embedded watermark. Conclusion: Experimental results\u000ademonstrated blindness and the robustness of the algorithm against common\u000adatabase attacks.

VThe term "performance portability" has been informally used in computing to\u000arefer to a variety of notions which generally include: 1) the ability to run\u000aone application across multiple hardware platforms; and 2) achieving some\u000anotional level of performance on these platforms. However, there has been a\u000anoticeable lack of consensus on the precise meaning of the term, and authors'\u000aconclusions regarding their success (or failure) to achieve performance\u000aportability have thus been subjective. Comparing one approach to performance\u000aportability with another has generally been marked with vague claims and\u000averbose, qualitative explanation of the comparison. This paper presents a\u000aconcise definition for performance portability, along with a simple metric that\u000aaccurately captures the performance and portability of an application across\u000adifferent platforms. The utility of this metric is then demonstrated with a\u000aretroactive application to previous work.

Every communication is\u000atreated as a distribution of content and caches are used within the network to\u000aimprove the effectiveness. While the performance gain of Content Centric\u000aNetworks is undoubted, there are questions about security and especially\u000aprivacy since it is not one of its main design principle. In this work, we\u000acompare the Content Centric Networking approach with the current Internet with\u000arespect to security and privacy. We analyze improvements that have been made\u000aand new problems that have yet to be resolved. The Internet of the future could\u000abe content-oriented, so it is essential to identify potential security and\u000aprivacy issues that are inherent to the architecture early on.

VScientific software applications are increasingly developed by large\u000ainterdiscplinary teams operating on functional modules organized around a\u000acommon software framework, which is capable of integrating new functional\u000acapabilities without modifying the core of the framework. In such environment,\u000asoftware correctness and modularity take precedence at the expense of code\u000aperformance, which is an important concern during execution on supercomputing\u000afacilities, where the allocation of core-hours is a valuable resource. To\u000aalleviate the performance problems, we propose automated performance tuning\u000a(autotuning) of software to extract the maximum performance on a given hardware\u000aplatform and to enable performance portability across heterogeneous hardware\u000aplatforms. The resulting code remains generic without committing to a\u000aparticular software stack and yet is compile-time specializable for maximal\u000asustained performance.

Important mathematical\u000aconcepts- such as the idea of number or the systems of numeration, whose formal\u000adefinition is currently independent of Euclidean spaces -have in the\u000aIsodimensional Discrete Mathematics (IDM) their roots in the DESs. This\u000amathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional\u000amathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the\u000aorthodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic\u000atool, or perhaps just "a simple curiosity." However, the IDM dis-crete\u000aapproaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.

VThe Web is our primary source of all kinds of information today. This\u000aincludes information about software as well as associated materials, like\u000asource code, documentation, related publications and change logs. Such data is\u000aof particular importance in research in order to conduct, comprehend and\u000areconstruct scientific experiments that involve software. swMATH, a\u000amathematical software directory, attempts to identify software mentions in\u000ascientific articles and provides additional information as well as links to the\u000aWeb. However, just like software itself, the Web is dynamic and most likely the\u000ainformation on the Web has changed since it was referenced in a scientific\u000apublication. Therefore, it is crucial to preserve the resources of a software\u000aon the Web to capture its states over time.\u000a  We found that around 40% of the websites in swMATH are already included in an\u000aexisting Web archive. Out of these, 60% of contain some kind of documentation\u000aand around 45% even provide downloads of software artifacts. Hence, already\u000atoday links can be established based on the publication dates of corresponding\u000aarticles. The contained data enable enriching existing information with a\u000atemporal dimension. In the future, specialized infrastructure will improve the\u000acoverage of software resources and allow explicit references in scientific\u000apublications.

VSTIMONT: A core ontology for multimedia stimuli description
p1640
sg704
VAffective multimedia documents such as images, sounds or videos elicit\u000aemotional responses in exposed human subjects. These stimuli are stored in\u000aaffective multimedia databases and successfully used for a wide variety of\u000aresearch in psychology and neuroscience in areas related to attention and\u000aemotion processing. Although important all affective multimedia databases have\u000anumerous deficiencies which impair their applicability. These problems, which\u000aare brought forward in the paper, result in low recall and precision of\u000amultimedia stimuli retrieval which makes creating emotion elicitation\u000aprocedures difficult and labor-intensive. To address these issues a new core\u000aontology STIMONT is introduced. The STIMONT is written in OWL-DL formalism and\u000aextends W3C EmotionML format with an expressive and formal representation of\u000aaffective concepts, high-level semantics, stimuli document metadata and the\u000aelicited physiology. The advantages of ontology in description of affective\u000amultimedia stimuli are demonstrated in a document retrieval experiment and\u000acompared against contemporary keyword-based querying methods. Also, a software\u000atool Intelligent Stimulus Generator for retrieval of affective multimedia and\u000aconstruction of stimuli sequences is presented.

VMany complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\u000aconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\u000asuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\u000aagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\u000athey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\u000acan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\u000avalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\u000aframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\u000aestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\u000amathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\u000asuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\u000aand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\u000asampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\u000adynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\u000aof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\u000auniversal model for computation.

VGraph clustering has many important applications in computing, but due to\u000agrowing sizes of graphs, even traditionally fast clustering methods such as\u000aspectral partitioning can be computationally expensive for real-world graphs of\u000ainterest. Motivated partly by this, so-called local algorithms for graph\u000aclustering have received significant interest due to the fact that they can\u000afind good clusters in a graph with work proportional to the size of the cluster\u000arather than that of the entire graph. This feature has proven to be crucial in\u000amaking such graph clustering and many of its downstream applications efficient\u000ain practice. While local clustering algorithms are already faster than\u000atraditional algorithms that touch the entire graph, they are sequential and\u000athere is an opportunity to make them even more efficient via parallelization.\u000aIn this paper, we show how to parallelize many of these algorithms in the\u000ashared-memory multicore setting, and we analyze the parallel complexity of\u000athese algorithms. We present comprehensive experiments on large-scale graphs\u000ashowing that our parallel algorithms achieve good parallel speedups on a modern\u000amulticore machine, thus significantly speeding up the analysis of local graph\u000aclusters in the very large-scale setting.

VMechanical learning is a computing system that is based on a set of simple\u000aand fixed rules, and can learn from incoming data. A learning machine is a\u000asystem that realizes mechanical learning. Importantly, we emphasis that it is\u000abased on a set of simple and fixed rules, contrasting to often called machine\u000alearning that is sophisticated software based on very complicated mathematical\u000atheory, and often needs human intervene for software fine tune and manual\u000aadjustments. Here, we discuss some basic facts and principles of such system,\u000aand try to lay down a framework for further study. We propose 2 directions to\u000aapproach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to\u000arealize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical\u000alearning.

After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated.

The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous\u000adecision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to\u000abe vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable\u000asocieties, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.

Two modern neural\u000anetwork models are investigated, a Denoising Autoencoder modified to produce\u000astochastic outputs and the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator.\u000aResults show that the neural network approach to learning genotypes is able to\u000asolve many difficult discrete problems, such as MaxSat and HIFF, and regularly\u000aoutperforms other evolutionary techniques.

VThis paper investigates the problem of implementing proportionate-type LMS\u000afamily of algorithms in hardware for sparse adaptive filtering applications\u000aespecially the network echo cancelation. We derive a re-formulated\u000aproportionate type algorithm through algorithm-architecture co-design\u000amethodology that can be pipelined and has an efficient architecture for\u000ahardware implementation. We study the convergence, steady-state and tracking\u000aperformances of these re-formulated algorithms for white, color and speech\u000ainputs before implementing them in hardware. To the best of our knowledge this\u000ais the first attempt to implement proportionate-type algorithms in hardware.

VIncremental View Maintenance for Deductive Graph Databases Using\u000a  Generalized Discrimination Networks
p1785
sg352
VNowadays, graph databases are employed when relationships between entities\u000aare in the scope of database queries to avoid performance-critical join\u000aoperations of relational databases. Graph queries are used to query and modify\u000agraphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching\u000athat is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be\u000aemployed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern\u000amatches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query\u000aperformance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with\u000athe graphs stored in the graph database.\u000a  In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as\u000atechnique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental\u000amaintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively\u000aand declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our\u000amaintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the\u000agraph database increases. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our approach\u000acan outperform existing approaches for the incremental maintenance of graph\u000aquery results.

VDatabase Security: A Historical Perspective
p1865

VThe importance of security in database research has greatly increased over\u000athe years as most of critical functionality of the business and military\u000aenterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information\u000asystem and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on\u000aphysical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be\u000acompromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading\u000aavailability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology\u000aenvironment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database\u000aresearch community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to\u000athe database security. The database research community has thoughts about these\u000aissues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will\u000aexamine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the\u000aadaption of the research to the changing environment. Some short term database\u000aresearch trends will be ascertained at the conclusion.

VProbabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability\u000atheory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified\u000adescription of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical\u000amodel. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful\u000aproperties:\u000a  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the\u000astructures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to\u000adesign and motivate new models.\u000a  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the\u000amodel, including the conditional independence properties.\u000a  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning\u000ain sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations,\u000ain which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\u000a  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including\u000abioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing\u000aanalysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models\u000aremains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over\u000athe space of all possible structures.\u000a  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure\u000alearning algorithms.

The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports.

This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VPerformance problems are often observed in embedded software systems. The\u000areasons for poor performance are frequently not obvious. Bottlenecks can occur\u000ain any of the software components along the execution path. Therefore it is\u000aimportant to instrument and monitor the different components contributing to\u000athe runtime behavior of an embedded software system. Performance analysis tools\u000acan help locate performance bottlenecks in embedded software systems by\u000amonitoring the software's execution and producing easily understandable\u000aperformance data. We maintain and further develop a tool for analyzing the\u000aperformance of Nokia mobile phone software.

VThis paper describes the digital library of historical resources, a research\u000aproject which involves building a testbed for the purpose of developing and\u000atesting new collaborative digital library functionality and presents an initial\u000aanalysis of the digital library's public use on the web. The digital library is\u000amodeled to focus on serving secondary students information needs in conducting\u000ahistory projects. As such, in the implementation of the digital library, the\u000ause of online resources would be an integral part of history project based\u000alearning activities. Students should be enabled to access digital resources,\u000acreate and publish their own documents in the digital library and share them\u000awith others. As a testbed system, the collaborative digital library known as\u000aCoreDev has demonstrated its capabilities in serving an educational community\u000aas has been reflected by the positive feedback on the functional requirements\u000afrom 44 users. Over 75% of the respondents in the user survey considered\u000athemselves capable of using the digital library easily. The beta tester\u000ademographics (n = 105) indicate that the digital library is reaching its target\u000acommunities.

VBy systematically applying ten well-known and inequivalent two-part relations\u000abetween hypergeometric sums 3F2(...|1) to the published database of all such\u000asums, 62 new sums are obtained. The existing literature is summarized, and many\u000apurportedly novel results extracted from that literature are shown to be\u000aspecial cases of these new sums. The general problem of finding elements\u000acontiguous to Watson's, Dixon's and Whipple's theorems is reduced to a simple\u000aalgorithm suitable for machine computation. Several errors in the literature\u000aare corrected or noted. The present paper both summarizes and extends a\u000aprevious work on this subject.

VOracle Complexity and Nontransitivity in Pattern Recognition
p1985
sg641
VDifferent mathematical models of recognition processes are known. In the\u000apresent paper we consider a pattern recognition algorithm as an oracle\u000acomputation on a Turing machine. Such point of view seems to be useful in\u000apattern recognition as well as in recursion theory. Use of recursion theory in\u000apattern recognition shows connection between a recognition algorithm comparison\u000aproblem and complexity problems of oracle computation. That is because in many\u000acases we can take into account only the number of sign computations or in other\u000awords volume of oracle information needed. Therefore, the problem of\u000arecognition algorithm preference can be formulated as a complexity optimization\u000aproblem of oracle computation. Furthermore, introducing a certain "natural"\u000apreference relation on a set of recognizing algorithms, we discover it to be\u000anontransitive. This relates to the well known nontransitivity paradox in\u000aprobability theory.\u000a  Keywords: Pattern Recognition, Recursion Theory, Nontransitivity, Preference\u000aRelation

VWe propose a comparative performance evaluation of security protocols. The\u000anovelty of our approach lies in the use of a polynomial mathematical model that\u000acaptures the performance of classes of cryptographic algorithms instead of\u000acapturing the performance of each algorithm separately, approach that is used\u000ain other papers. A major advantage of using such a model is that it does not\u000arequire implementation-specific information, because the decision is based on\u000acomparing the estimated performances of protocols instead of actually\u000aevaluating them. The approach is validated by comparatively evaluating the\u000aperformances of 1000 automatically generated security protocols against the\u000aperformances of their actual implementations.

VThe paper is devoted to hyperbolic (generally speaking, non-Lagrangian and\u000anonlinear) partial differential systems possessing a full set of differential\u000aoperators that map any function of one independent variable into a symmetry of\u000athe corresponding system. We demonstrate that a system has the above property\u000aif and only if this system admits a full set of formal integrals (i.e.\u000adifferential operators which map symmetries into integrals of the system). As a\u000aconsequence, such systems possess both direct and inverse Noether operators (in\u000athe terminology of a work by B. Fuchssteiner and A.S. Fokas who have used these\u000aterms for operators that map cosymmetries into symmetries and back). Systems\u000aadmitting Noether operators are not exhausted by Euler-Lagrange systems and the\u000asystems with formal integrals. In particular, a hyperbolic system admits an\u000ainverse Noether operator if a differential substitution maps this system into a\u000asystem possessing an inverse Noether operator.

VThe Evolution of the Computerized Database

VDatabases, collections of related data, are as old as the written word. A\u000adatabase can be anything from a homemaker's metal recipe file to a\u000asophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we\u000ainvariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management\u000asystems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box\u000aor cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How\u000adid the computerized database evolve?\u000a  This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the\u000adatabase, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now\u000astandard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early\u000acomputerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed\u000aSequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage\u000amethods. Early database models are explored including the network and\u000ahierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and\u000aobject-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams,\u000aincluding hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity\u000arelationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to\u000asupport the text.\u000a  This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS\u000adevelopment. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into\u000athe relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented\u000adevelopment methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS.

Noisy operations usually drive a system to evolve\u000ainto a mixed state and damage the coherence. Sometimes frequent noisy\u000aoperations result in the coherent evolution of a subsystem, and the dynamics of\u000athe subsystem is controlled by tuning noisy operations. Based on this, we find\u000athat universal quantum computation can be carried out by low-fidelity (fidelity\u000a$<90\u005c%$) operations.

VIn information retrieval research, precision and recall have long been used\u000ato evaluate IR systems. However, given that a number of retrieval systems\u000aresembling one another are already available to the public, it is valuable to\u000aretrieve novel relevant documents, i.e., documents that cannot be retrieved by\u000athose existing systems. In view of this problem, we propose an evaluation\u000amethod that favors systems retrieving as many novel documents as possible. We\u000aalso used our method to evaluate systems that participated in the IREX\u000aworkshop.

VMultiagent systems consist of agents that locally exchange information\u000athrough a physical network subject to a graph topology. Current control methods\u000afor networked multiagent systems assume the knowledge of graph topologies in\u000aorder to design distributed control laws for achieving desired global system\u000abehaviors. However, this assumption may not be valid for situations where graph\u000atopologies are subject to uncertainties either due to changes in the physical\u000anetwork or the presence of modeling errors especially for multiagent systems\u000ainvolving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this\u000astandpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent\u000asystems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a\u000acontroller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in\u000aresponse to system variations. Specifically, we analytically show that the\u000aproposed controller drives the trajectories of a networked multiagent system\u000asubject to a graph topology with time-varying uncertainties to a close\u000aneighborhood of the trajectories of a given reference model having a desired\u000agraph topology. As a special case, we also show that a networked multi-agent\u000asystem subject to a graph topology with constant uncertainties asymptotically\u000aconverges to the trajectories of a given reference model. Although the main\u000aresult of this paper is presented in the context of average consensus problem,\u000athe proposed framework can be used for many other problems related to networked\u000amultiagent systems with uncertain graph topologies.

VDue to the extensive use of information technology and the recent\u000adevelopments in multimedia systems, the amount of multimedia data available to\u000ausers has increased exponentially. Video is an example of multimedia data as it\u000acontains several kinds of data such as text, image, meta-data, visual and\u000aaudio. Content based video retrieval is an approach for facilitating the\u000asearching and browsing of large multimedia collections over WWW. In order to\u000acreate an effective video retrieval system, visual perception must be taken\u000ainto account. We conjectured that a technique which employs multiple features\u000afor indexing and retrieval would be more effective in the discrimination and\u000asearch tasks of videos. In order to validate this, content based indexing and\u000aretrieval systems were implemented using color histogram, Texture feature\u000a(GLCM), edge density and motion..

VEnhancing Content-And-Structure Information Retrieval using a Native XML\u000a  Database
p2233
sg291
VThree approaches to content-and-structure XML retrieval are analysed in this\u000apaper: first by using Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; second\u000aby using eXist, a native XML database, and third by using a hybrid XML\u000aretrieval system that uses eXist to produce the final answers from likely\u000arelevant articles retrieved by Zettair. INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics\u000acan be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as\u000afinal answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles\u000aas final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid\u000asystem improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For\u000aranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval\u000amodel that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of\u000aa native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements. The final\u000aresults of our experiments show that when the XML retrieval task focusses on\u000ahighly relevant elements our hybrid XML retrieval system with the Coherent\u000aRetrieval Elements module is 1.8 times more effective than Zettair and 3 times\u000amore effective than eXist, and yields an effective content-and-structure XML\u000aretrieval.

VIn a given space of models or hypothesis the individual information content\u000aof each of them is considered as opposed to the Shannon entropy that measures\u000athe average information content of the mentioned space. In particular\u000aexpressing Bayes Theorem in terms of the information contents associated to its\u000aprobabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the\u000asystem by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space.\u000aIt is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information\u000asources are generated: the Information Content Associated to the Evidence that\u000aalways introduces positive information, and the Information Content Associated\u000ato the Bayes Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the\u000aevidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and\u000athe likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference\u000abetween these two mentioned information contents, the information that arrives\u000ato a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric,\u000agiven by the difference of the two mentioned information contents called\u000atransfer information content which measures the information transferred to each\u000aof the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem\u000a(MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed\u000aallows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the\u000acounterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information.\u000aThe implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to\u000athe emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience\u000a(particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding) are proposed as\u000afurther work.

VAccumulating evidence indicates that the capacity to integrate information in\u000athe brain is a prerequisite for consciousness. Integrated Information Theory\u000a(IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the\u000ainformation integrated in a system, called integrated information, $\u005cPhi$.\u000aIntegrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a\u000asystem generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of\u000ainformation its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of\u000aintegrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness.\u000aEmpirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated information\u000afrom neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with using\u000athe original measure $\u005cPhi$ precludes such computations. Although some\u000apractical measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures\u000afail to satisfy the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated\u000ainformation. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and\u000aupper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0\u000awhen the system does not generate information (no information) or when the\u000asystem comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of\u000aintegrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole\u000asystem and is realized when the amount of information generated independently\u000aby its parts equals to 0. Here we derive the novel practical measure $\u005cPhi^*$\u000aby introducing a concept of mismatched decoding developed from information\u000atheory. We show that $\u005cPhi^*$ is properly bounded from below and above, as\u000arequired, as a measure of integrated information. We derive the analytical\u000aexpression $\u005cPhi^*$ under the Gaussian assumption, which makes it readily\u000aapplicable to experimental data.

VDynamic Information Retrieval: Theoretical Framework and Application
p2313
sg291
VTheoretical frameworks like the Probability Ranking Principle and its more\u000arecent Interactive Information Retrieval variant have guided the development of\u000aranking and retrieval algorithms for decades, yet they are not capable of\u000ahelping us model problems in Dynamic Information Retrieval which exhibit the\u000afollowing three properties; an observable user signal, retrieval over multiple\u000astages and an overall search intent. In this paper a new theoretical framework\u000afor retrieval in these scenarios is proposed. We derive a general dynamic\u000autility function for optimizing over these types of tasks, that takes into\u000aaccount the utility of each stage and the probability of observing user\u000afeedback. We apply our framework to experiments over TREC data in the dynamic\u000amulti page search scenario as a practical demonstration of its effectiveness\u000aand to frame the discussion of its use, its limitations and to compare it\u000aagainst the existing frameworks.

VWe examine natural expectations on communication performance using MPI\u000aderived datatypes in comparison to the baseline, "raw" performance of\u000acommunicating simple, non-contiguous data layouts. We show that common MPI\u000alibraries sometimes violate these datatype performance expectations, and\u000adiscuss reasons why this happens, but also show cases where MPI libraries\u000aperform well. Our findings are in many ways surprising and disappointing.\u000aFirst, the performance of derived datatypes is sometimes worse than the\u000asemantically equivalent packing and unpacking using the corresponding MPI\u000afunctionality. Second, the communication performance equivalence stated in the\u000aMPI standard between a single contiguous datatype and the repetition of its\u000aconstituent datatype does not hold universally. Third, the heuristics that are\u000atypically employed by MPI libraries at type-commit time are insufficient to\u000aenforce natural performance guidelines, and better type normalization\u000aheuristics may have a significant performance impact. We show cases where all\u000athe MPI type constructors are necessary to achieve the expected performance for\u000acertain data layouts. We describe our benchmarking approach to verify the\u000adatatype performance guidelines, and present extensive verification results for\u000adifferent MPI libraries.

VThis paper examines the use of scientometric overlay mapping as a tool of\u000a'strategic intelligence' to aid the governance of emerging technologies. We\u000adevelop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and\u000aassociated perspectives on technological emergence across the geographical,\u000asocial, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyse (with\u000apublication and patent data) three case-studies of emerging technologies in the\u000amedical domain. These are: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)\u000atesting technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase\u000a(TPMT) genetic testing. Given the flexibility (i.e. adaptability to different\u000asources of data) and granularity (i.e. applicability across multiple levels of\u000adata aggregation) of overlay mapping techniques, we argue that these techniques\u000acan favour the integration and comparison of results from different contexts\u000aand cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a 'distributed'\u000astrategic intelligence for analysts and decision-makers.

We introduce bistochastic QFA (MM-BQFA), a model\u000awhich generalizes both Nayak's enhanced QFA and DH-PRA. We apply tools from\u000aalgebraic automata theory and systems of linear inequalities to give a complete\u000acharacterization of R1 languages recognized by all these models.

VA Novel Approach to Multimedia Ontology Engineering for Automated\u000a  Reasoning over Audiovisual LOD Datasets
p2508
sg704
VMultimedia reasoning, which is suitable for, among others, multimedia content\u000aanalysis and high-level video scene interpretation, relies on the formal and\u000acomprehensive conceptualization of the represented knowledge domain. However,\u000amost multimedia ontologies are not exhaustive in terms of role definitions, and\u000ado not incorporate complex role inclusions and role interdependencies. In fact,\u000amost multimedia ontologies do not have a role box at all, and implement only a\u000abasic subset of the available logical constructors. Consequently, their\u000aapplication in multimedia reasoning is limited. To address the above issues,\u000aVidOnt, the very first multimedia ontology with SROIQ(D) expressivity and a\u000aDL-safe ruleset has been introduced for next-generation multimedia reasoning.\u000aIn contrast to the common practice, the formal grounding has been set in one of\u000athe most expressive description logics, and the ontology validated with\u000aindustry-leading reasoners, namely HermiT and FaCT++. This paper also presents\u000abest practices for developing multimedia ontologies, based on my ontology\u000aengineering approach.

VA grid computing system is designed for solving complicated scientific and\u000acommercial problems effectively,whereas mobile computing is a traditional\u000adistributed system having computing capability with mobility and adopting\u000awireless communications. Media and Entertainment fields can take advantage from\u000aboth paradigms by applying its usage in gaming applications and multimedia data\u000amanagement. Multimedia data has to be stored and retrieved in an efficient and\u000aeffective manner to put it in use. In this paper, we proposed an application\u000alayer protocol for delivery of multimedia data in wireless girds i.e.\u000amultimedia grid protocol (MMGP). To make streaming efficient a new video\u000acompression algorithm called dWave is designed and embedded in the proposed\u000aprotocol. This protocol will provide faster, reliable access and render an\u000aimperceptible QoS in delivering multimedia in wireless grid environment and\u000atackles the challenging issues such as i) intermittent connectivity, ii) device\u000aheterogeneity, iii) weak security and iv) device mobility.

VClustering problems have numerous applications and are becoming more\u000achallenging as the size of the data increases. In this paper, we consider\u000adesigning clustering algorithms that can be used in MapReduce, the most popular\u000aprogramming environment for processing large datasets. We focus on the\u000apractical and popular clustering problems, $k$-center and $k$-median. We\u000adevelop fast clustering algorithms with constant factor approximation\u000aguarantees. From a theoretical perspective, we give the first analysis that\u000ashows several clustering algorithms are in $\u005cmathcal{MRC}^0$, a theoretical\u000aMapReduce class introduced by Karloff et al. \u005ccite{KarloffSV10}. Our algorithms\u000ause sampling to decrease the data size and they run a time consuming clustering\u000aalgorithm such as local search or Lloyd's algorithm on the resulting data set.\u000aOur algorithms have sufficient flexibility to be used in practice since they\u000arun in a constant number of MapReduce rounds. We complement these results by\u000aperforming experiments using our algorithms. We compare the empirical\u000aperformance of our algorithms to several sequential and parallel algorithms for\u000athe $k$-median problem. The experiments show that our algorithms' solutions are\u000asimilar to or better than the other algorithms' solutions. Furthermore, on data\u000asets that are sufficiently large, our algorithms are faster than the other\u000aparallel algorithms that we tested.

Although the mean\u000ashift algorithm has been used in many applications, a rigorous proof of its\u000aconvergence is still missing in the literature. In this paper we address the\u000aconvergence of the mean shift algorithm in the one-dimensional space and prove\u000athat the sequence generated by the mean shift algorithm is a monotone and\u000aconvergent sequence.

VPhase Retrieval From the Magnitudes of Affine Linear Measurements
p2563
sg291
VIn this paper, we consider the phase retrieval problem in which one aims to\u000arecover a signal from the magnitudes of affine measurements. Let $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m \u005csubset {\u005cmathbb H}^d$ and ${\u005cmathbf b}=(b_1, \u005cldots,\u000ab_m)^\u005ctop\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^m$, where ${\u005cmathbb H}={\u005cmathbb R}$ or ${\u005cmathbb C}$.\u000aWe say $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf a}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ are affine phase retrievable\u000afor ${\u005cmathbb H}^d$ if any ${\u005cmathbf x}\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^d$ can be recovered from\u000athe magnitudes of the affine measurements $\u005c{|<{\u005cmathbf a}_j,{\u005cmathbf\u000ax}>+b_j|,\u005c, 1\u005cleq j\u005cleq m\u005c}$. We develop general framework for affine phase\u000aretrieval and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ to be affine phase retrievable. We establish\u000aresults on minimal measurements and generic measurements for affine phase\u000aretrieval as well as on sparse affine phase retrieval. In particular, we also\u000ahighlight some notable differences between affine phase retrieval and the\u000astandard phase retrieval in which one aims to recover a signal $\u005cmathbf x$ from\u000athe magnitudes of its linear measurements. In standard phase retrieval, one can\u000aonly recover $\u005cmathbf x$ up to a unimodular constant, while affine phase\u000aretrieval removes this ambiguity. We prove that unlike standard phase\u000aretrieval, the affine phase retrievable measurements $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ do not form an open set in ${\u005cmathbb\u000aH}^{m\u005ctimes d}\u005ctimes {\u005cmathbb H}^m$. Also in the complex setting, the standard\u000aphase retrieval requires $4d-O(\u005clog_2d)$ measurements, while the affine phase\u000aretrieval only needs $m=3d$ measurements.

VEach individual handles many tasks of finding the most profitable option from\u000aa set of options that stochastically provide rewards. Our society comprises a\u000acollection of such individuals, and the society is expected to maximise the\u000atotal rewards, while the individuals compete for common rewards. Such\u000acollective decision making is formulated as the `competitive multi-armed bandit\u000aproblem (CBP)', requiring a huge computational cost. Herein, we demonstrate a\u000aprototype of an analog computer that efficiently solves CBPs by exploiting the\u000aphysical dynamics of numerous fluids in coupled cylinders. This device enables\u000athe maximisation of the total rewards for the society without paying the\u000aconventionally required computational cost; this is because the fluids estimate\u000athe reward probabilities of the options for the exploitation of past knowledge\u000aand generate random fluctuations for the exploration of new knowledge. Our\u000aresults suggest that to optimise the social rewards, the utilisation of\u000afluid-derived natural fluctuations is more advantageous than applying\u000aartificial external fluctuations. Our analog computing scheme is expected to\u000atrigger further studies for harnessing the huge computational power of natural\u000aphenomena for resolving a wide variety of complex problems in modern\u000ainformation society.

VMobile Multimedia Recommendation in Smart Communities: A Survey

sg704
VDue to the rapid growth of internet broadband access and proliferation of\u000amodern mobile devices, various types of multimedia (e.g. text, images, audios\u000aand videos) have become ubiquitously available anytime. Mobile device users\u000ausually store and use multimedia contents based on their personal interests and\u000apreferences. Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have however\u000aintroduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. In order to\u000atackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that\u000arecommend multimedia for mobile users. In this survey paper, we examine the\u000aimportance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of\u000athree smart communities, namely, mobile social learning, mobile event guide and\u000acontext-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that\u000athe implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems\u000acan improve mobile multimedia recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still\u000achallenges and open issues such as the incorporation of context and social\u000aproperties, which need to be tackled in order to generate accurate and\u000atrustworthy mobile multimedia recommendations.

VQuotients, exactness, and nuclearity in the operator system category
p2608
sg188
VWe continue our study of tensor products in the operator system category. We\u000adefine operator system quotients and exactness in this setting and refine the\u000anotion of nuclearity by studying operator systems that preserve various pairs\u000aof tensor products. One of our main goals is to relate these refinements of\u000anuclearity to the Kirchberg conjecture. In particular, we prove that the\u000aKirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every operator system\u000athat is (min,er)-nuclear is also (el,c)-nuclear. We show that operator system\u000aquotients are not always equal to the corresponding operator space quotients\u000aand then study exactness of various operator system tensor products for the\u000aoperator system quotient. We prove that an operator system is exact for the min\u000atensor product if and only if it is (min,el)-nuclear. We give many\u000acharacterizations of operator systems that are (min,er)-nulcear,\u000a(el,c)-nuclear, (min,el)-nulcear and (el,max)-nuclear. These characterizations\u000ainvolve operator system analogues of various properties from the theory of\u000aC*-algebras and operator spaces, including the WEP and LLP.

VSecuring the Data in Clouds with Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography
p2628
sg47
VIn todays world, Cloud computing has attracted research communities as it\u000aprovides services in reduced cost due to virtualizing all the necessary\u000aresources. Even modern business architecture depends upon Cloud computing .As\u000ait is a internet based utility, which provides various services over a network,\u000ait is prone to network based attacks. Hence security in clouds is the most\u000aimportant in case of cloud computing. Cloud Security concerns the customer to\u000afully rely on storing data on clouds. That is why Cloud security has attracted\u000aattention of the research community. This paper will discuss securing the data\u000ain clouds by implementing key agreement, encryption and signature\u000averification/generation with hyperelliptic curve cryptography.

VGeneral Capacity for Deterministic Dissemination in Wireless Ad Hoc\u000a  Networks
p2638
sg175
VIn this paper, we study capacity scaling laws of the deterministic\u000adissemination (DD) in random wireless networks under the generalized physical\u000amodel (GphyM). This is truly not a new topic. Our motivation to readdress this\u000aissue is two-fold: Firstly, we aim to propose a more general result to unify\u000athe network capacity for general homogeneous random models by investigating the\u000aimpacts of different parameters of the system on the network capacity.\u000aSecondly, we target to close the open gaps between the upper and the lower\u000abounds on the network capacity in the literature. The generality of this work\u000alies in three aspects: (1) We study the homogeneous random network of a general\u000anode density $\u005clambda \u005cin [1,n]$, rather than either random dense network (RDN,\u000a$\u005clambda=n$) or random extended network (REN, $\u005clambda=1$) as in the\u000aliterature. (2) We address the general deterministic dissemination sessions,\u000a\u005cie, the general multicast sessions, which unify the capacities for unicast and\u000abroadcast sessions by setting the number of destinations for each session as a\u000ageneral value $n_d\u005cin[1,n]$. (3) We allow the number of sessions to change in\u000athe range $n_s\u005cin(1,n]$, instead of assuming that $n_s=\u005cTheta(n)$ as in the\u000aliterature. We derive the general upper bounds on the capacity for the\u000aarbitrary case of $(\u005clambda, n_d, n_s)$ by introducing the Poisson Boolean\u000amodel of continuum percolation, and prove that they are tight according to the\u000aexisting general lower bounds constructed in the literature.

VFormally expressing the semantics of observer-based fault detection\u000a  software
p2643
sg92
VThe aim is to create reliable and verifiable fault detection software to\u000adetect abrupt changes in safety-critical dynamic systems. Fault detection\u000amethods are implemented as software on digital computers that monitor and\u000acontrol the system. We implement three observer-based fault detection methods\u000aon a 3 degrees of freedom (3DOF) laboratory helicopter, in the form of\u000asoftware. We examine the performance of those methods to detect different\u000afaults during flight in a closed-loop setup. All selected methods show\u000aacceptable detection performance. However, it is not possible to repeat the\u000atest for every possible conditions, inputs and fault scenarios. In this paper,\u000awe translate fault detection properties and mathematical proofs into a formal\u000alanguage, previously used in software validation and verification. We include\u000athe translated properties in software in the form of non-executable annotations\u000athat can be read by machine. Consequently, some high level functional\u000aproperties of the code can be verified by automatic software verification\u000atools. This certifies fault detection software for a set of bounded data and\u000aincreases the reliability in practice.

VMultimedia Database Applications: Issues and Concerns for Classroom\u000a  Teaching
p2653
sg704
VThe abundance of multimedia data and information is challenging educators to\u000aeffectively search, browse, access, use, and store the data for their classroom\u000ateaching. However, many educators could still be accustomed to teaching or\u000asearching for information using conventional methods, but often the\u000aconventional methods may not function well with multimedia data. Educators need\u000ato efficiently interact and manage a variety of digital media files too. The\u000apurpose of this study is to review current multimedia database applications in\u000ateaching and learning, and further discuss some of the issues or concerns that\u000aeducators may have while incorporating multimedia data into their classrooms.\u000aSome strategies and recommendations are also provided in order for educators to\u000abe able to use multimedia data more effectively in their teaching environments.

For the patent network the optimal value of the PageRank damping\u000afactor is close to 0.5; the application of d=0.85 leads to unacceptable ranking\u000aresults.

VScalable Continual Top-k Keyword Search in Relational Databases
p2688
sg352
VKeyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent\u000ayears because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured\u000aquery language nor to know the complex underlying database schemas. Most of\u000aexisting methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static\u000adatabases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users\u000amay have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation,\u000ait is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in a database system\u000ato support continual keyword queries.\u000a  In this paper, we propose an efficient method for answering continual top-$k$\u000akeyword queries over relational databases. The proposed method is built on an\u000aexisting scheme of keyword search on relational data streams, but incorporates\u000athe ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two\u000aimprovements to support efficient top-$k$ keyword search in relational\u000adatabases. Compared to the existing methods, our method is more efficient both\u000ain computing the top-$k$ results in a static database and in maintaining the\u000atop-$k$ results when the database continually being updated. Experimental\u000aresults validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

VTowards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning
p2708
sg55
VAs machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of\u000ainterest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation\u000afor their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess\u000aother criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the\u000ainterest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what\u000ainterpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this\u000aposition paper, we first define interpretability and describe when\u000ainterpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy\u000afor rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous\u000ascience of interpretable machine learning.

This extends our\u000arecent results where we proved this under the assumption that also the spectrum\u000ais uniformly discrete. As an application we obtain that Hof's quasicrystals\u000awith uniformly discrete diffraction spectra must have a periodic diffraction\u000astructure.

VWhat Is an Emerging Technology?
p2718
sg76
VThere is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel\u000atechnologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of\u000astudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\u000aconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\u000adesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\u000aaims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\u000alinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\u000aoperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\u000acombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\u000a'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\u000aissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\u000aattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\u000aradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\u000aimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\u000aemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\u000aattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\u000ain, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\u000astudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\u000acitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\u000aand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\u000aattributes of emergence.

VEdge Detection for Pattern Recognition: A Survey

VThis review provides an overview of the literature on the edge detection\u000amethods for pattern recognition that inspire from the understanding of human\u000avision. We note that edge detection is one of the most fundamental process\u000awithin the low level vision and provides the basis for the higher level visual\u000aintelligence in primates. The recognition of the patterns within the images\u000arelate closely to the spatiotemporal processes of edge formations, and its\u000aimplementation needs a crossdisciplanry approach in neuroscience, computing and\u000apattern recognition. In this review, the edge detectors are grouped in as edge\u000afeatures, gradients and sketch models, and some example applications are\u000aprovided for reference. We note a significant increase in the amount of\u000apublished research in the last decade that utilizes edge features in a wide\u000arange of problems in computer vision and image understanding having a direct\u000aimplication to pattern recognition with images.

The descendant\u000acode of a sub-code ${\u005ccal C}^{'} \u005csubseteq {\u005ccal C}$ is defined to be ${\u005ccal\u000aC}^{'}(1) \u005ctimes {\u005ccal C}^{'}(2) \u005ctimes \u005ccdots \u005ctimes {\u005ccal C}^{'}(n)$. In this\u000apaper, we introduce a multimedia analogue of codes with the identifiable parent\u000aproperty (IPP), called multimedia IPP codes or $t$-MIPPC$(n, M, q)$, so that\u000agiven the descendant code of any sub-code ${\u005ccal C}^{'}$ of a multimedia\u000a$t$-IPP code ${\u005ccal C}$, one can always identify, as IPP codes do in the\u000ageneric digital scenario, at least one codeword in ${\u005ccal C}^{'}$. We first\u000aderive a general upper bound on the size $M$ of a multimedia $t$-IPP code, and\u000athen investigate multimedia $3$-IPP codes in more detail. We characterize a\u000amultimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$ in terms of a bipartite graph and a\u000ageneralized packing, respectively. By means of these combinatorial\u000acharacterizations, we further derive a tight upper bound on the size of a\u000amultimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$, and construct several infinite families\u000aof (asymptotically) optimal multimedia $3$-IPP codes of length $2$.

VCellular automata for the spreading of technologies in socio-economic\u000a  systems
p2793
sg76
VWe introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological\u000adevelopments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for\u000athe collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different\u000atechnologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to\u000athe difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when\u000atechnologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and\u000aproviders of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading\u000ato microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and\u000acomputer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of\u000adifferent technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the\u000aspreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of\u000athe system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced\u000atechnologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.\u000aWe show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with\u000aa power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the\u000aspreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order\u000astatistics.

VOur results demonstrated that a previously reported protein name\u000aco-occurrence method (5-mention PubGene) which was not based on a hypothesis\u000atesting framework, it is generally statistically more significant than the 99th\u000apercentile of Poisson distribution-based method of calculating co-occurrence.\u000aIt agrees with previous methods using natural language processing to extract\u000aprotein-protein interaction from text as more than 96% of the interactions\u000afound by natural language processing methods to overlap with the results from\u000a5-mention PubGene method. However, less than 2% of the gene co-expressions\u000aanalyzed by microarray were found from direct co-occurrence or interaction\u000ainformation extraction from the literature. At the same time, combining\u000amicroarray and literature analyses, we derive a novel set of 7 potential\u000afunctional protein-protein interactions that had not been previously described\u000ain the literature.

VAutomatic Conversion of Relational Databases into Ontologies: A\u000a  Comparative Analysis of Protégé Plug-ins Performances
p2818
sg352
VConstructing ontologies from relational databases is an active research topic\u000ain the Semantic Web domain. While conceptual mapping rules/principles of\u000arelational databases and ontology structures are being proposed, several\u000asoftware modules or plug-ins are being developed to enable the automatic\u000aconversion of relational databases into ontologies. However, the correlation\u000abetween the resulting ontologies built automatically with plug-ins from\u000arelational databases and the database-to-ontology mapping principles has been\u000agiven little attention. This study reviews and applies two Prot\u005c'eg\u005c'e\u000aplug-ins, namely, DataMaster and OntoBase to automatically construct ontologies\u000afrom a relational database. The resulting ontologies are further analysed to\u000amatch their structures against the database-to-ontology mapping principles. A\u000acomparative analysis of the matching results reveals that OntoBase outperforms\u000aDataMaster in applying the database-to-ontology mapping principles for\u000aautomatically converting relational databases into ontologies.
