VIn this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri\u000alanguage, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now,\u000athere is no computational work available for the language. Finite state\u000amorphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of\u000alanguages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to\u000aanalyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.

p33
sg15
VIn the first of this pair of papers, it was proven that that no physical\u000acomputer can correctly carry out all computational tasks that can be posed to\u000ait. The generality of this result follows from its use of a novel definition of\u000acomputation, ``physical computation''. This second paper of the pair elaborates\u000athe mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical\u000acomputation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing\u000aMachines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the\u000a(im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an\u000aanalogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is\u000aelaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction\u000acomplexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal\u000aphysical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding''\u000abound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing\u000amachine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it\u000ais proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type\u000aof computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic\u000ainformation complexity).

In experiments with 1303 Bible\u000atranslations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity\u000aof multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors\u000acapture genetic relationships between languages.

We show that if one-way\u000afunctions exist, no algorithm can compute the multiplicative complexity in time\u000a$2^{O(n)}$ given the truth table of length $2^n$, in fact under the same\u000aassumption it is impossible to approximate the multiplicative complexity within\u000aa factor of $(2-\u005cepsilon)^{n/2}$. When given a circuit, the problem of\u000adetermining the multiplicative complexity is in the second level of the\u000apolynomial hierarchy. For nonlinearity, we show that it is #P hard to compute\u000agiven a function represented by a circuit.

VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

VIn the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic\u000atransformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions. While the\u000abenefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks\u000ato our society. After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated.

VModel-based language specification has applications in the implementation of\u000alanguage processors, the design of domain-specific languages, model-driven\u000asoftware development, data integration, text mining, natural language\u000aprocessing, and corpus-based induction of models. Model-based language\u000aspecification decouples language design from language processing and, unlike\u000atraditional grammar-driven approaches, which constrain language designers to\u000aspecific kinds of grammars, it needs general parser generators able to deal\u000awith ambiguities. In this paper, we propose Fence, an efficient bottom-up\u000aparsing algorithm with lexical and syntactic ambiguity support that enables the\u000ause of model-based language specification in practice.

VLanguage segmentation consists in finding the boundaries where one language\u000aends and another language begins in a text written in more than one language.\u000aThis is important for all natural language processing tasks. The problem can be\u000asolved by training language models on language data. However, in the case of\u000alow- or no-resource languages, this is problematic. I therefore investigate\u000awhether unsupervised methods perform better than supervised methods when it is\u000adifficult or impossible to train supervised approaches. A special focus is\u000agiven to difficult texts, i.e. texts that are rather short (one sentence),\u000acontaining abbreviations, low-resource languages and non-standard language. I\u000acompare three approaches: supervised n-gram language models, unsupervised\u000aclustering and weakly supervised n-gram language model induction. I devised the\u000aweakly supervised approach in order to deal with difficult text specifically.\u000aIn order to test the approach, I compiled a small corpus of different text\u000atypes, ranging from one-sentence texts to texts of about 300 words. The weakly\u000asupervised language model induction approach works well on short and difficult\u000atexts, outperforming the clustering algorithm and reaching scores in the\u000avicinity of the supervised approach. The results look promising, but there is\u000aroom for improvement and a more thorough investigation should be undertaken.

VWe show that there are Turing complete computably enumerable sets of\u000aarbitrarily low non-trivial initial segment prefix-free complexity. In\u000aparticular, given any computably enumerable set $A$ with non-trivial\u000aprefix-free initial segment complexity, there exists a Turing complete\u000acomputably enumerable set $B$ with complexity strictly less than the complexity\u000aof $A$. On the other hand it is known that sets with trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity are not Turing complete.\u000a  Moreover we give a generalization of this result for any finite collection of\u000acomputably enumerable sets $A_i, i<k$ with non-trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity. An application of this gives a negative answer to a\u000aquestion from \u005ccite[Section 11.12]{rodenisbook} and \u005ccite{MRmerstcdhdtd} which\u000aasked for minimal pairs in the structure of the c.e.\u005c reals ordered by their\u000ainitial segment prefix-free complexity.\u000a  Further consequences concern various notions of degrees of randomness. For\u000aexample, the Solovay degrees and the $K$-degrees of computably enumerable reals\u000aand computably enumerable sets are not elementarily equivalent. Also, the\u000adegrees of randomness based on plain and prefix-free complexity are not\u000aelementarily equivalent; the same holds for their $\u005cDelta^0_2$ and $\u005cSigma^0_1$\u000asubstructures.

VWe introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word\u000aembedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as\u000adivergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.\u000aUsing such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural\u000alanguages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a\u000acollection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for\u000afifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VBiology-derived algorithms are an important part of computational sciences,\u000awhich are essential to many scientific disciplines and engineering\u000aapplications. Many computational methods are derived from or based on the\u000aanalogy to natural evolution and biological activities, and these biologically\u000ainspired computations include genetic algorithms, neural networks, cellular\u000aautomata, and other algorithms.

VThe Cartier-Perrin theorem, which was published in 1995 and is expressed in\u000athe language of nonstandard analysis, permits, for the first time perhaps, a\u000aclear-cut mathematical definition of the volatility of a financial asset. It\u000ayields as a byproduct a new understanding of the means of returns, of the beta\u000acoefficient, and of the Sharpe and Treynor ratios. New estimation techniques\u000afrom automatic control and signal processing, which were already successfully\u000aapplied in quantitative finance, lead to several computer experiments with some\u000aquite convincing forecasts.

VMost languages use the relative order between words to encode meaning\u000arelations. Languages differ, however, in what orders they use and how these\u000aorders are mapped onto different meanings. We test the hypothesis that, despite\u000athese differences, human languages might constitute different `solutions' to\u000acommon pressures of language use. Using Monte Carlo simulations over data from\u000afive languages, we find that their word orders are efficient for processing in\u000aterms of both dependency length and local lexical probability. This suggests\u000athat biases originating in how the brain understands language strongly\u000aconstrain how human languages change over generations.

VWe propose to study maximum flow problems for connectome graphs. We suggest a\u000afew computational problems: finding vertex pairs with maximal flow, finding new\u000aedges which would increase the maximal flow. Initial computation results for\u000asome publicly available connectome graphs are described.

VThe current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which\u000adisrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the prevailing view of\u000asociety is based on the ontological primacy of stable hierarchical structures,\u000awhich is no longer adequate.\u000a  We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing\u000asocial system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it\u000afollows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of\u000aindividuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive\u000aprocesses in the evolution of a system.\u000a  The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system -- an ecology of\u000ainteracting social subsystems -- each of which is also a living cognitive\u000asystem. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social\u000asystems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The\u000aLiving Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics\u000aand the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of\u000aInformation and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work.\u000a  We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research -- distributed\u000asocial governance -- which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on\u000astable structures within global society.
