VVarious XML-based approaches aimed at representing compound digital assets\u000ahave emerged over the last several years. Approaches that are of specific\u000arelevance to the digital library community include the Metadata Encoding and\u000aTransmission Standard (METS), the IMS Content Packaging XML Binding, and the\u000aXML Formatted Data Units (XFDU) developed by CCSDS Panel 2. The MPEG-21 Digital\u000aItem Declaration (MPEG-21 DID) is another standard specifying the\u000arepresentation of digital assets in XML that, so far, has received little\u000aattention in the digital library community. This article gives a brief insight\u000ainto the MPEG-21 standardization effort, highlights the major characteristics\u000aof the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model, and describes the MPEG-21 Digital Item\u000aDeclaration Language (MPEG-21 DIDL), an XML syntax for the representation of\u000adigital assets based on the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model. Also, it briefly\u000ademonstrates the potential relevance of MPEG-21 DID to the digital library\u000acommunity by describing its use in the aDORe repository environment at the\u000aResearch Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for the\u000arepresentation of digital assets.

VThis paper, the first step to connect relational databases with systems\u000aconsequence (Kent: "System Consequence" 2009), is concerned with the semantics\u000aof relational databases. It aims to to study system consequence in the\u000alogical/semantic system of relational databases. The paper, which was inspired\u000aby and which extends a recent set of papers on the theory of relational\u000adatabase systems (Spivak: "Functorial Data Migration" 2012), is linked with\u000awork on the Information Flow Framework (IFF) [http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/]\u000aconnected with the ontology standards effort (SUO), since relational databases\u000anaturally embed into first order logic. The database semantics discussed here\u000ais concerned with the conceptual level of database architecture. We offer both\u000aan intuitive and technical discussion. Corresponding to the notions of primary\u000aand foreign keys, relational database semantics takes two forms: a\u000adistinguished form where entities are distinguished from relations, and a\u000aunified form where relations and entities coincide. The distinguished form\u000acorresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Simplicial databases"\u000a2009)[arXiv:0904.2012]. The unified form, a special case of the distinguished\u000aform, corresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Functorial Data\u000aMigration" 2012). A later paper will discuss various formalisms of relational\u000adatabases, such as relational algebra and first order logic, and will complete\u000athe description of the relational database logical environment.

The digital library is\u000amodeled to focus on serving secondary students information needs in conducting\u000ahistory projects. As such, in the implementation of the digital library, the\u000ause of online resources would be an integral part of history project based\u000alearning activities. Students should be enabled to access digital resources,\u000acreate and publish their own documents in the digital library and share them\u000awith others. As a testbed system, the collaborative digital library known as\u000aCoreDev has demonstrated its capabilities in serving an educational community\u000aas has been reflected by the positive feedback on the functional requirements\u000afrom 44 users. Over 75% of the respondents in the user survey considered\u000athemselves capable of using the digital library easily.

When given a circuit, the problem of\u000adetermining the multiplicative complexity is in the second level of the\u000apolynomial hierarchy.

VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated. Modern information and\u000acommunication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and\u000astrategic benefits. The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous\u000adecision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to\u000abe vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable\u000asocieties, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.

VCurrent security model in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\u000apredominantly use symmetric key cryptography. The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\u000asymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\u000aadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VNowadays, graph databases are employed when relationships between entities\u000aare in the scope of database queries to avoid performance-critical join\u000aoperations of relational databases. Graph queries are used to query and modify\u000agraphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching\u000athat is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be\u000aemployed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern\u000amatches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query\u000aperformance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with\u000athe graphs stored in the graph database.\u000a  In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as\u000atechnique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental\u000amaintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively\u000aand declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our\u000amaintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the\u000agraph database increases. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our approach\u000acan outperform existing approaches for the incremental maintenance of graph\u000aquery results.

VThe importance of security in database research has greatly increased over\u000athe years as most of critical functionality of the business and military\u000aenterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information\u000asystem and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on\u000aphysical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be\u000acompromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading\u000aavailability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology\u000aenvironment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database\u000aresearch community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to\u000athe database security. The database research community has thoughts about these\u000aissues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will\u000aexamine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the\u000aadaption of the research to the changing environment. Some short term database\u000aresearch trends will be ascertained at the conclusion.

VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VIndexed languages are interesting in computational linguistics because they\u000aare the least class of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy that has not been\u000ashown not to be adequate to describe the string set of natural language\u000asentences. We here define a class of unification grammars that exactly describe\u000athe class of indexed languages.

VWe study new classes of games, called zero-sum equivalent games and zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these\u000aclasses of games. We say that two games are "strategically equivalent" if, for\u000aevery player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other\u000aplayers' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game\u000athat is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent\u000apotential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent\u000ato a common interest game. We also call a game "normalized" if the sum of one\u000aplayer's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show\u000athat any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common\u000ainterest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we\u000ashow that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets\u000agenerically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a\u000astrictly dominant Nash equilibrium.

VWe introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word\u000aembedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as\u000adivergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.\u000aUsing such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural\u000alanguages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a\u000acollection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for\u000afifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VThe Cartier-Perrin theorem, which was published in 1995 and is expressed in\u000athe language of nonstandard analysis, permits, for the first time perhaps, a\u000aclear-cut mathematical definition of the volatility of a financial asset. It\u000ayields as a byproduct a new understanding of the means of returns, of the beta\u000acoefficient, and of the Sharpe and Treynor ratios. New estimation techniques\u000afrom automatic control and signal processing, which were already successfully\u000aapplied in quantitative finance, lead to several computer experiments with some\u000aquite convincing forecasts.

VMost existing models for multilingual natural language processing (NLP) treat\u000alanguage as a discrete category, and make predictions for either one language\u000aor the other. In contrast, we propose using continuous vector representations\u000aof language. We show that these can be learned efficiently with a\u000acharacter-based neural language model, and used to improve inference about\u000alanguage varieties not seen during training. In experiments with 1303 Bible\u000atranslations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity\u000aof multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors\u000acapture genetic relationships between languages.
