VIn this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri\u000alanguage, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now,\u000athere is no computational work available for the language. Finite state\u000amorphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of\u000alanguages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to\u000aanalyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.

VThis article is a brief guide to the field of algorithmic information theory\u000a(AIT), its underlying philosophy, and the most important concepts. AIT arises\u000aby mixing information theory and computation theory to obtain an objective and\u000aabsolute notion of information in an individual object, and in so doing gives\u000arise to an objective and robust notion of randomness of individual objects.\u000aThis is in contrast to classical information theory that is based on random\u000avariables and communication, and has no bearing on information and randomness\u000aof individual objects. After a brief overview, the major subfields,\u000aapplications, history, and a map of the field are presented.

VThe aim of this paper is to bring together the notions of quantum game and\u000agame isomorphism. The work is intended as an attempt to introduce a new\u000acriterion for quantum game schemes. The generally accepted requirement forces a\u000aquantum scheme to generate the classical game in a particular case. Now, given\u000aa quantum game scheme and two isomorphic classical games, we additionally\u000arequire the resulting quantum games to be isomorphic as well. We are concerned\u000awith the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantum game scheme and the strong\u000aisomorphism between games in strategic form.

VNetwork Function Virtualization (NFV) refers to the use of commodity hardware\u000aresources as the basic platform to perform specialized network functions as\u000aopposed to specialized hardware devices. Currently, NFV is mainly implemented\u000abased on general purpose processors, or general purpose network processors. In\u000athis paper we propose the use of FPGAs as an ideal platform for NFV that can be\u000aused to provide both the flexibility of virtualizations and the high\u000aperformance of the specialized hardware.

VSystematic literature studies have received much attention in empirical\u000asoftware engineering in recent years. They have become a powerful tool to\u000acollect and structure reported knowledge in a systematic and reproducible way.\u000aWe distinguish systematic literature reviews to systematically analyze reported\u000aevidence in depth, and systematic mapping studies to structure a field of\u000ainterest in a broader, usually quantified manner. Due to the rapidly increasing\u000abody of knowledge in software engineering, researchers who want to capture the\u000apublished work in a domain often face an extensive amount of publications,\u000awhich need to be screened, rated for relevance, classified, and eventually\u000aanalyzed. Although there are several guidelines to conduct literature studies,\u000athey do not yet help researchers coping with the specific difficulties\u000aencountered in the practical application of these guidelines. In this article,\u000awe present an experience-based guideline to aid researchers in designing\u000asystematic literature studies with special emphasis on the data collection and\u000aselection procedures. Our guideline aims at providing a blueprint for a\u000apractical and pragmatic path through the plethora of currently available\u000apractices and deliverables capturing the dependencies among the single steps.\u000aThe guideline emerges from various mapping studies and literature reviews\u000aconducted by the authors and provides recommendations for the general study\u000adesign, data collection, and study selection procedures. Finally, we share our\u000aexperiences and lessons learned in applying the different practices of the\u000aproposed guideline.

VUnderstanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers\u000aboth system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature\u000aengineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more\u000aintuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in\u000amachine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found\u000arenewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as\u000anon-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even\u000awhen they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability\u000ais of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to\u000ainterpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for\u000aexplaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By\u000atreating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches\u000aprovide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and\u000arepresentations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety\u000aof users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and\u000areview a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that\u000aaddresses these challenges.

VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

The Script Language has the\u000aoperations of insert, update, delete, union, intersect, and minus for the table\u000ain the database.The Script Language is edited by a text file and you can easily\u000amodify the computing formula in the text file to deal with the situations when\u000athe computing formula have been changed.

VThis paper explores the notion of approximate data structures, which return\u000aapproximately correct answers to queries, but run faster than their exact\u000acounterparts. The paper describes approximate variants of the van Emde Boas\u000adata structure, which support the same dynamic operations as the standard van\u000aEmde Boas data structure (min, max, successor, predecessor, and existence\u000aqueries, as well as insertion and deletion), except that answers to queries are\u000aapproximate. The variants support all operations in constant time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polylog(n), and in O(loglogn) time provided the\u000aperformance guarantee is 1+1/polynomial(n), for n elements in the data\u000astructure.\u000a  Applications described include Prim's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm,\u000aDijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm, and an on-line variant of\u000aGraham's convex hull algorithm. To obtain output which approximates the desired\u000aoutput with the performance guarantee tending to 1, Prim's algorithm requires\u000aonly linear time, Dijkstra's algorithm requires O(mloglogn) time, and the\u000aon-line variant of Graham's algorithm requires constant amortized time per\u000aoperation.

VRecently, a review concluded that Google Scholar (GS) is not a suitable\u000asource of information "for identifying recent conference papers or other gray\u000aliterature publications". The goal of this letter is to demonstrate that GS can\u000abe an effective tool to search and find gray literature, as long as appropriate\u000asearch strategies are used. To do this, we took as examples the same two case\u000astudies used by the original review, describing first how GS processes\u000aoriginal's search strategies, then proposing alternative search strategies, and\u000afinally generalizing each case study to compose a general search procedure\u000aaimed at finding gray literature in Google Scholar for two wide selected case\u000astudies: a) all contributions belonging to a congress (the ASCO Annual\u000aMeeting); and b) indexed guidelines as well as gray literature within medical\u000ainstitutions (National Institutes of Health) and governmental agencies (U.S.\u000aDepartment of Health & Human Services). The results confirm that original\u000asearch strategies were undertrained offering misleading results and erroneous\u000aconclusions. Google Scholar lacks many of the advanced search features\u000aavailable in other bibliographic databases (such as Pubmed), however, it is one\u000athing to have a friendly search experience, and quite another to find gray\u000aliterature. We finally conclude that Google Scholar is a powerful tool for\u000asearching gray literature, as long as the users are familiar with all the\u000apossibilities it offers as a search engine. Poorly formulated searches will\u000aundoubtedly return misleading results.

VRetrieval and content management are assumed to be mutually exclusive. In\u000athis paper we suggest that they need not be so. In the usual information\u000aretrieval scenario, some information about queries leading to a website (due to\u000a`hits' or `visits') is available to the server administrator of the concerned\u000awebsite. This information can used to better present the content on the\u000awebsite. Further, we suggest that some more information can be shared by the\u000aretrieval system with the content provider. This will enable the content\u000aprovider (any website) to have a more dynamic presentation of the content that\u000ais in tune with the query trends, without violating the privacy of the querying\u000auser. The result will be a better synchronization between retrieval systems and\u000acontent providers, with the purpose of improving the user's web search\u000aexperience. This will also give the content provider a say in this process,\u000agiven that the content provider is the one who knows much more about the\u000acontent than the retrieval system. It also means that the content presentation\u000amay change in response to a query. In the end, the user will be able to find\u000athe relevant content more easily and quickly.

VThe DNA cryptography is a new and very promising direction in cryptography\u000aresearch. DNA can be used in cryptography for storing and transmitting the\u000ainformation, as well as for computation. Although in its primitive stage, DNA\u000acryptography is shown to be very effective. Currently, several DNA computing\u000aalgorithms are proposed for quite some cryptography, cryptanalysis and\u000asteganography problems, and they are very powerful in these areas. However, the\u000ause of the DNA as a means of cryptography has high tech lab requirements and\u000acomputational limitations, as well as the labor intensive extrapolation means\u000aso far. These make the efficient use of DNA cryptography difficult in the\u000asecurity world now. Therefore, more theoretical analysis should be performed\u000abefore its real applications.\u000a  In this project, We do not intended to utilize real DNA to perform the\u000acryptography process; rather, We will introduce a new cryptography method based\u000aon central dogma of molecular biology. Since this method simulates some\u000acritical processes in central dogma, it is a pseudo DNA cryptography method.\u000aThe theoretical analysis and experiments show this method to be efficient in\u000acomputation, storage and transmission; and it is very powerful against certain\u000aattacks. Thus, this method can be of many uses in cryptography, such as an\u000aenhancement insecurity and speed to the other cryptography methods. There are\u000aalso extensions and variations to this method, which have enhanced security,\u000aeffectiveness and applicability.

These systems exploit the\u000aavailable structural information, as market up in XML documents, in order to\u000areturn documents components- the so called XML elements-instead of the\u000acomplement documents in repose to the user query. In this paper, we provide an\u000aoverview of the different XML information retrieval systems and classify them\u000aaccording to their storage and query evaluation strategies.

VEffective emergency and natural disaster management depend on the efficient\u000amission-critical voice and data communication between first responders and\u000avictims. Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband technology used\u000afor critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.\u000aRecently Long Term Evolution (LTE) emerged as a broadband communication\u000atechnology that has a potential to transform the capabilities of public safety\u000atechnologies by providing broadband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical voice and\u000adata support. For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a\u000anationwide coast-to-coast public safety network based of LTE broadband\u000atechnology. This paper presents a comparative survey of legacy and the\u000aLTE-based public safety networks, and discusses the LMRS-LTE convergence as\u000awell as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A simulation study of LMRS and\u000aLTE band class 14 technologies is provided using the NS-3 open source tool. An\u000aexperimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class 14 is also conducted using\u000asoftware-defined radio, to enhance the understanding of the public safety\u000asystems. Finally, emerging technologies that may have strong potential for use\u000ain public safety networks are reviewed.

The model combines\u000athe methods and experiences of cognitive-to-interpret indexing languages with\u000athe strengths and possibilities of formal knowledge representation. The core\u000acomponent of the model uses inferences along the paths of typed relations\u000abetween the entities of a knowledge representation for enabling the\u000adetermination of hit quantities in the context of retrieval processes. The\u000aentities are arranged in aspect-oriented facets to ensure a consistent\u000ahierarchical structure. The possible consequences for indexing and retrieval\u000aare discussed.

VWe introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word\u000aembedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as\u000adivergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.\u000aUsing such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural\u000alanguages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a\u000acollection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for\u000afifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VThis paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning\u000afrom a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models\u000ainclude Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and\u000aundirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are\u000aextended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of\u000aplates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are\u000aprovided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of\u000aprobability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas\u000afor learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the\u000aexpectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some\u000apopular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This\u000aincludes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks,\u000aand learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper\u000aconcludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how\u000asome popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original\u000acontributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that\u000agraphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex\u000alearning algorithms.

VWe study new classes of games, called zero-sum equivalent games and zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these\u000aclasses of games. We say that two games are "strategically equivalent" if, for\u000aevery player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other\u000aplayers' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game\u000athat is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent\u000apotential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent\u000ato a common interest game. We also call a game "normalized" if the sum of one\u000aplayer's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show\u000athat any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common\u000ainterest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we\u000ashow that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets\u000agenerically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a\u000astrictly dominant Nash equilibrium.

However, due to exponential growth of transistor density\u000aand in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers\u000aexpect that "Conventional Technologies" like Complementary Metal-Oxide\u000aSemiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the\u000aneeds for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are\u000aneeded. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of\u000aconventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising\u000asolution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high\u000aspeed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the\u000ainput data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new\u000atechnology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the\u000aacceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side\u000atransformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge\u000ato designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible\u000acircuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track.\u000aIn this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on binary logic system\u000ahas been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in binary logic\u000asystem and output as reversible circuit.

VThe current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which\u000adisrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the prevailing view of\u000asociety is based on the ontological primacy of stable hierarchical structures,\u000awhich is no longer adequate.\u000a  We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing\u000asocial system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it\u000afollows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of\u000aindividuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive\u000aprocesses in the evolution of a system.\u000a  The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system -- an ecology of\u000ainteracting social subsystems -- each of which is also a living cognitive\u000asystem. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social\u000asystems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The\u000aLiving Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics\u000aand the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of\u000aInformation and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work.\u000a  We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research -- distributed\u000asocial governance -- which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on\u000astable structures within global society.

VIn the first of this pair of papers, it was proven that that no physical\u000acomputer can correctly carry out all computational tasks that can be posed to\u000ait. The generality of this result follows from its use of a novel definition of\u000acomputation, ``physical computation''. This second paper of the pair elaborates\u000athe mathematical structure and impossibility results associated with physical\u000acomputation. Analogues of Chomsky hierarcy results concerning universal Turing\u000aMachines and the Halting theorem are derived, as are results concerning the\u000a(im)possibility of certain kinds of error-correcting codes. In addition, an\u000aanalogue of algorithmic information complexity, ``prediction complexity'', is\u000aelaborated. A task-independent bound is derived on how much the prediction\u000acomplexity of a computational task can differ for two different universal\u000aphysical computers used to solve that task, a bound similar to the ``encoding''\u000abound governing how much the algorithm information complexity of a Turing\u000amachine calculation can differ for two universal Turing machines. Finally, it\u000ais proven that either the Hamiltonian of our universe proscribes a certain type\u000aof computation, or prediction complexity is unique (unlike algorithmic\u000ainformation complexity).

VReaction automata are a formal model that has been introduced to investigate\u000athe computing powers of interactive behaviors of biochemical reactions([14]).\u000aReaction automata are language acceptors with multiset rewriting mechanism\u000awhose basic frameworks are based on reaction systems introduced in [4]. In this\u000apaper we continue the investigation of reaction automata with a focus on the\u000aformal language theoretic properties of subclasses of reaction automata, called\u000alinearbounded reaction automata (LRAs) and exponentially-bounded reaction\u000aautomata (ERAs). Besides LRAs, we newly introduce an extended model (denoted by\u000alambda-LRAs) by allowing lambda-moves in the accepting process of reaction, and\u000ainvestigate the closure properties of language classes accepted by both LRAs\u000aand lambda-LRAs. Further, we establish new relationships of language classes\u000aaccepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results\u000ainclude the following : (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs\u000aforms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively\u000aenumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language\u000aaccepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides\u000awith the class of context-sensitive languages.

VIn this paper we formalize the notions of information elements and\u000ainformation lattices, first proposed by Shannon. Exploiting this formalization,\u000awe identify a comprehensive parallelism between information lattices and\u000asubgroup lattices. Qualitatively, we demonstrate isomorphisms between\u000ainformation lattices and subgroup lattices. Quantitatively, we establish a\u000adecisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information\u000alattices and the log-index structures of the corresponding subgroup lattices.\u000aThis approximation extends the approximation for joint entropies carried out\u000apreviously by Chan and Yeung. As a consequence of our approximation result, we\u000ashow that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of information\u000aelements if and only if the same law holds in general for the log-indices of\u000asubgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples we find\u000asurprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither\u000athe submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of\u000ainformation elements is conceptually significant--formalizing it helps to\u000areveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The\u000aparallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action\u000aexplanation and provides useful insights into the intrinsic structure among\u000ainformation elements from a group-theoretic perspective.

We formalize this as an instance of linear feature-based IR (Metzler and\u000aCroft, 2007), illustrating how a variety of knowledge discovery tasks are\u000acaptured under this approach, leading to a 44% improvement in recall for\u000acandidate triage for QA.

VThis paper, the first step to connect relational databases with systems\u000aconsequence (Kent: "System Consequence" 2009), is concerned with the semantics\u000aof relational databases. It aims to to study system consequence in the\u000alogical/semantic system of relational databases. The paper, which was inspired\u000aby and which extends a recent set of papers on the theory of relational\u000adatabase systems (Spivak: "Functorial Data Migration" 2012), is linked with\u000awork on the Information Flow Framework (IFF) [http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/]\u000aconnected with the ontology standards effort (SUO), since relational databases\u000anaturally embed into first order logic. The database semantics discussed here\u000ais concerned with the conceptual level of database architecture. We offer both\u000aan intuitive and technical discussion. Corresponding to the notions of primary\u000aand foreign keys, relational database semantics takes two forms: a\u000adistinguished form where entities are distinguished from relations, and a\u000aunified form where relations and entities coincide. The distinguished form\u000acorresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Simplicial databases"\u000a2009)[arXiv:0904.2012]. The unified form, a special case of the distinguished\u000aform, corresponds to the theory presented in (Spivak: "Functorial Data\u000aMigration" 2012). A later paper will discuss various formalisms of relational\u000adatabases, such as relational algebra and first order logic, and will complete\u000athe description of the relational database logical environment.

VA large number of computational scientific research projects make use of open\u000asource software packages. However, the development process of such tools\u000afrequently differs from conventional software development; partly because of\u000athe nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fully\u000aunderstood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried out\u000aby scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices of\u000asoftware engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressure\u000ato publish scientific results and that credit for software development is\u000alimited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering like\u000amodular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and software\u000aintegration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to be\u000adisregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovative\u000adevelopments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to master\u000adevelopment for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions. The growing\u000acomplexity of research, however, requires suitable and maintainable\u000acomputational tools, resulting in a widening gap between the potential users\u000a(often growing in number) and contributors to the development of such a\u000apackage. In this paper we share our experiences aiming to improve the situation\u000aby training particularly young scientists, through disseminating our own\u000aexperiences at contributing to open source software packages and practicing key\u000acomponents of software engineering adapted for scientists and scientific\u000asoftware development. Specifically we summarize the outcome of the Workshop in\u000aAdvanced Techniques for Scientific Programming and Collaborative Development of\u000aOpen Source Software Packages run at the Abdus Salam International Centre for\u000aTheoretical Physics in March 2013, and discuss our conclusions for future\u000aefforts.

This paper shows how the MDPC architecture improves the usability\u000aof the specification and the implementation of graphical interaction. The\u000aarchitecture is based on the use of picking views and inverse transforms from\u000athe graphics to the data. With three examples of graphical interaction, we show\u000ahow to express them with the architecture, how to implement them, and how this\u000aimproves programming usability. Moreover, we show that it enables implementing\u000agraphical interaction without a scene graph. This kind of code prevents from\u000aerrors due to cache consistency management.

VThe popularity of the Mobile Database is increasing day by day as people need\u000ainformation even on the move in the fast changing world. This database\u000atechnology permits employees using mobile devices to connect to their corporate\u000anetworks, hoard the needed data, work in the disconnected mode and reconnect to\u000athe network to synchronize with the corporate database. In this scenario, the\u000adata is being moved closer to the applications in order to improve the\u000aperformance and autonomy. This leads to many interesting problems in mobile\u000adatabase research and Mobile Database has become a fertile land for many\u000aresearchers. In this paper a survey is presented on data and Transaction\u000amanagement in Mobile Databases from the year 2000 onwards. The survey focuses\u000aon the complete study on the various types of Architectures used in Mobile\u000adatabases and Mobile Transaction Models. It also addresses the data management\u000aissues namely Replication and Caching strategies and the transaction management\u000afunctionalities such as Concurrency Control and Commit protocols,\u000aSynchronization, Query Processing, Recovery and Security.

VThe field of digital libraries (DLs) coalesced in 1994: the first digital\u000alibrary conferences were held that year, awareness of the World Wide Web was\u000aaccelerating, and the National Science Foundation awarded $24 Million (U.S.)\u000afor the Digital Library Initiative (DLI). In this paper we examine the state of\u000athe DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to\u000athe co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital\u000alibrary conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract\u000aseveral established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional\u000anetwork model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define\u000a$AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the\u000anetwork. The results are validated against conference program committee members\u000ain the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and\u000aAuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also\u000ainvestigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint\u000aConference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).

VThis paper introduces and studies a declarative framework for updating views\u000aover indefinite databases. An indefinite database is a database with null\u000avalues that are represented, following the standard database approach, by a\u000asingle null constant. The paper formalizes views over such databases as\u000aindefinite deductive databases, and defines for them several classes of\u000adatabase repairs that realize view-update requests. Most notable is the class\u000aof constrained repairs. Constrained repairs change the database "minimally" and\u000aavoid making arbitrary commitments. They narrow down the space of alternative\u000aways to fulfill the view-update request to those that are grounded, in a\u000acertain strong sense, in the database, the view and the view-update request.

VThis decade has seen a great deal of progress in the development of\u000ainformation retrieval systems. Unfortunately, we still lack a systematic\u000aunderstanding of the behavior of the systems and their relationship with\u000adocuments. In this paper we present a completely new approach towards the\u000aunderstanding of the information retrieval systems. Recently, it has been\u000aobserved that retrieval systems in TREC 6 show some remarkable patterns in\u000aretrieving relevant documents. Based on the TREC 6 observations, we introduce a\u000ageometric linear model of information retrieval systems. We then apply the\u000amodel to predict the number of relevant documents by the retrieval systems. The\u000amodel is also scalable to a much larger data set. Although the model is\u000adeveloped based on the TREC 6 routing test data, I believe it can be readily\u000aapplicable to other information retrieval systems. In Appendix, we explained a\u000asimple and efficient way of making a better system from the existing systems.

VA lossy source coding problem is studied in which a source encoder\u000acommunicates with two decoders, one with and one without correlated side\u000ainformation with an additional constraint on the privacy of the side\u000ainformation at the uninformed decoder. Two cases of this problem arise\u000adepending on the availability of the side information at the encoder. The set\u000aof all feasible rate-distortion-equivocation tuples are characterized for both\u000acases. The difference between the informed and uninformed cases and the\u000aadvantages of encoder side information for enhancing privacy are highlighted\u000afor a binary symmetric source with erasure side information and Hamming\u000adistortion.

VPart 1 has studied the conversion of observed random process with its hidden\u000ainformation to related dynamic process, applying entropy functional measure\u000a(EF) of the random process and path functional information measure (IPF) of the\u000adynamic conversion process. The variation principle, satisfying the EF-IPF\u000aequivalence along shortest path-trajectory, leads to information dual\u000acomplementary maxmin-minimax law, which creates mechanism of arising\u000ainformation regularities from stochastic process(Lerner 2012). This Part 2\u000astudies mechanism of cooperation of the observed multiple hidden information\u000aprocess, which follows from the law and produces cooperative structures,\u000aconcurrently assembling in hierarchical information network (IN) and generating\u000athe IN digital genetic code. We analyze the interactive information\u000acontributions, information quality, inner time scale, information geometry of\u000athe cooperative structures, evaluate curvature of these geometrical forms and\u000atheir cooperative information complexities. The law information mechanisms\u000aoperate in information observer. The observer, acting according the law,\u000aselects random information, converts it in information dynamics, builds the IN\u000acooperatives, which generate the genetic code.

VThis paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we develop a new\u000ainformation theory, in which it is not a coincidence that information and\u000aphysical entropy share the same mathematical formula. It is an adaptation of\u000amind to help search for resources. We then show that psychological patterns\u000aeither reflect the constraints of physical laws or are evolutionary adaptations\u000ato efficiently process information and to increase the chance of survival in\u000athe environment of our evolutionary past. In the second part, we demonstrate\u000athat the new information theory provides the foundation to understand market\u000abehavior. One fundamental result from the information theory is that\u000ainformation is costly. In general, information with higher value is more\u000acostly. Another fundamental result from the information theory is that the\u000aamount of information one can receive is the amount of information generated\u000aminus equivocation. The level of equivocation, which is the measure of\u000ainformation asymmetry, is determined by the correlation between the source of\u000ainformation and the receiver of information. In general, how much information\u000aone can receive depends on the background knowledge of the receiver. The\u000adifference in cost different investors are willing to pay for information and\u000athe difference in background knowledge about a particular information causes\u000athe heterogeneity in information processing by the investment public, which is\u000athe main reason of the price and volume patterns observed in the market. Many\u000aassumptions in some of the recent models on behavioral finance can be derived\u000anaturally from this theory.

VFrom the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for\u000athe activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning\u000aapplications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental\u000atheoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is\u000aconstrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the\u000aTuring Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe\u000aitself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the\u000apresent paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy\u000apoint of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination\u000aof learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying\u000aagent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the\u000aproblem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in\u000areality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for\u000alearning Turing machines.

VWe show that there are Turing complete computably enumerable sets of\u000aarbitrarily low non-trivial initial segment prefix-free complexity. In\u000aparticular, given any computably enumerable set $A$ with non-trivial\u000aprefix-free initial segment complexity, there exists a Turing complete\u000acomputably enumerable set $B$ with complexity strictly less than the complexity\u000aof $A$. On the other hand it is known that sets with trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity are not Turing complete.\u000a  Moreover we give a generalization of this result for any finite collection of\u000acomputably enumerable sets $A_i, i<k$ with non-trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity. An application of this gives a negative answer to a\u000aquestion from \u005ccite[Section 11.12]{rodenisbook} and \u005ccite{MRmerstcdhdtd} which\u000aasked for minimal pairs in the structure of the c.e.\u005c reals ordered by their\u000ainitial segment prefix-free complexity.\u000a  Further consequences concern various notions of degrees of randomness. For\u000aexample, the Solovay degrees and the $K$-degrees of computably enumerable reals\u000aand computably enumerable sets are not elementarily equivalent. Also, the\u000adegrees of randomness based on plain and prefix-free complexity are not\u000aelementarily equivalent; the same holds for their $\u005cDelta^0_2$ and $\u005cSigma^0_1$\u000asubstructures.

It is\u000acommon in industrial practice that high level control algorithm development and\u000alow level code implementation on hardware platforms are developed separately\u000awith limited shared information. However, software code and hardware\u000aarchitecture become closely related with the increasing complexity. Correlated\u000arequirements and dependencies between hardware and software are emerging\u000aproblems of industrial practice. We demonstrate in this paper a method to link\u000amodel based system design with real-time simulations and analysis of the\u000aarchitecture model. This allows hardware software co-design and thus early\u000aselection of hardware architecture.

VThis paper explores the emergence of norms in agents' societies when agents\u000aplay multiple -even incompatible- roles in their social contexts\u000asimultaneously, and have limited interaction ranges. Specifically, this article\u000aproposes two reinforcement learning methods for agents to compute agreements on\u000astrategies for using common resources to perform joint tasks. The computation\u000aof norms by considering agents' playing multiple roles in their social contexts\u000ahas not been studied before. To make the problem even more realistic for open\u000asocieties, we do not assume that agents share knowledge on their common\u000aresources. So, they have to compute semantic agreements towards performing\u000atheir joint actions. %The paper reports on an empirical study of whether and\u000ahow efficiently societies of agents converge to norms, exploring the proposed\u000asocial learning processes w.r.t. different society sizes, and the ways agents\u000aare connected. The results reported are very encouraging, regarding the speed\u000aof the learning process as well as the convergence rate, even in quite complex\u000asettings.

VA class of languages C is perfect if it is closed under Boolean operations\u000aand the emptiness problem is decidable. Perfect language classes are the basis\u000afor the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if\u000athe language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad\u000atraces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for\u000aCFLs is undecidable, no class containing the CFLs can be perfect.\u000a  In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect\u000aare often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all\u000abehaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a\u000asubset of behaviors is by using bounded languages (languages of the form w1*\u000a... wk* for fixed words w1,...,wk). A class of languages C is perfect modulo\u000abounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every\u000abounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every\u000abounded language.\u000a  We consider finding perfect classes of languages modulo bounded languages. We\u000ashow that the class of languages accepted by multi-head pushdown automata are\u000aperfect modulo bounded languages, and characterize the complexities of decision\u000aproblems. We also show that bounded languages form a maximal class for which\u000aperfection is obtained. We show that computations of several known models of\u000asystems, such as recursive multi-threaded programs, recursive counter machines,\u000aand communicating finite-state machines can be encoded as multi-head pushdown\u000aautomata, giving uniform and optimal underapproximation algorithms modulo\u000abounded languages.

VIn this paper we consider the class of lambda-nondeterministic linear\u000aautomata as a model of the class of linear languages. As usual in other\u000aautomata models, lambda-moves do not increase the acceptance power. The main\u000acontribution of this paper is to introduce the deterministic linear automata\u000aand even linear automata, i.e. the natural restriction of nondeterministic\u000alinear automata for the deterministic and even linear language classes,\u000arespectively. In particular, there are different, but not equivalents,\u000aproposals for the class of "deterministic" linear languages. We proved here\u000athat the class of languages accepted by the deterministic linear automata are\u000anot contained in any of the these classes and in fact they properly contain\u000athese classes. Another, contribution is the generation of an infinite hierarchy\u000aof formal languages, going from the class of languages accepted by\u000adeterministic linear automata and achieved, in the limit, the class of linear\u000alanguages.

VThis paper investigates the impact of three approaches to XML retrieval:\u000ausing Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; using eXist, a native\u000aXML database; and using a hybrid system that takes full article answers from\u000aZettair and uses eXist to extract elements from those articles. For the\u000acontent-only topics, we undertake a preliminary analysis of the INEX 2003\u000arelevance assessments in order to identify the types of highly relevant\u000adocument components. Further analysis identifies two complementary sub-cases of\u000arelevance assessments ("General" and "Specific") and two categories of topics\u000a("Broad" and "Narrow"). We develop a novel retrieval module that for a\u000acontent-only topic utilises the information from the resulting answer list of a\u000anative XML database and dynamically determines the preferable units of\u000aretrieval, which we call "Coherent Retrieval Elements". The results of our\u000aexperiments show that -- when each of the three systems is evaluated against\u000adifferent retrieval scenarios (such as different cases of relevance\u000aassessments, different topic categories and different choices of evaluation\u000ametrics) -- the XML retrieval systems exhibit varying behaviour and the best\u000aperformance can be reached for different values of the retrieval parameters. In\u000athe case of INEX 2003 relevance assessments for the content-only topics, our\u000anewly developed hybrid XML retrieval system is substantially more effective\u000athan either Zettair or eXist, and yields a robust and a very effective XML\u000aretrieval.

Results: The\u000aalgorithm is robust as it resists attempts to remove or degrade the embedded\u000awatermark and it is blind as it does not require the original database in order\u000ato extract the embedded watermark.

VRecent technological advances have made lightweight, head mounted cameras\u000aboth practical and affordable and products like Google Glass show first\u000aapproaches to introduce the idea of egocentric (first-person) video to the\u000amainstream. Interestingly, the computer vision community has only recently\u000astarted to explore this new domain of egocentric vision, where research can\u000aroughly be categorized into three areas: Object recognition, activity\u000adetection/recognition, video summarization. In this paper, we try to give a\u000abroad overview about the different problems that have been addressed and\u000acollect and compare evaluation results. Moreover, along with the emergence of\u000athis new domain came the introduction of numerous new and versatile benchmark\u000adatasets, which we summarize and compare as well.

VThis first "Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval" (BIR 2014) workshop\u000aaims to engage with the IR community about possible links to bibliometrics and\u000ascholarly communication. Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to\u000aenhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer\u000avalue-added effects for users. In this workshop we will explore how statistical\u000amodelling of scholarship, such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of\u000aco-authorship network, can improve retrieval services for specific communities,\u000aas well as for large, cross-domain collections. This workshop aims to raise\u000aawareness of the missing link between information retrieval (IR) and\u000abibliometrics / scientometrics and to create a common ground for the\u000aincorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into retrieval at the digital\u000alibrary interface. Our interests include information retrieval, information\u000aseeking, science modelling, network analysis, and digital libraries. The goal\u000ais to apply insights from bibliometrics, scientometrics, and informetrics to\u000aconcrete practical problems of information retrieval and browsing.

VLindstr\u005c"om theorems characterize logics in terms of model-theoretic\u000aconditions such as Compactness and the L\u005c"owenheim-Skolem property. Most\u000aexisting characterizations of this kind concern extensions of first-order\u000alogic. But on the other hand, many logics relevant to computer science are\u000afragments or extensions of fragments of first-order logic, e.g., k-variable\u000alogics and various modal logics. Finding Lindstr\u005c"om theorems for these\u000alanguages can be challenging, as most known techniques rely on coding arguments\u000athat seem to require the full expressive power of first-order logic. In this\u000apaper, we provide Lindstr\u005c"om theorems for several fragments of first-order\u000alogic, including the k-variable fragments for k>2, Tarski's relation algebra,\u000agraded modal logic, and the binary guarded fragment. We use two different proof\u000atechniques. One is a modification of the original Lindstr\u005c"om proof. The other\u000ainvolves the modal concepts of bisimulation, tree unraveling, and finite depth.\u000aOur results also imply semantic preservation theorems.

In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health\u000amonitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of\u000alow-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning\u000aprovides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data.\u000aThe main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research\u000awork of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief\u000aintroduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in\u000amachine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following\u000aaspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and\u000aits variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines\u000a(DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\u000aFinally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are\u000adiscussed.

VThe empirical and theoretical justification of Gartner hype curves is a very\u000arelevant open question in the field of Technological Life Cycle analysis. The\u000ascope of the present paper is to introduce a simple model describing the growth\u000aof scientific/technological research impact, in the specific case where science\u000ais the main source of a new idea driving a technological development, leading\u000ato hype-type evolution curves. The main idea of the model is that, in a first\u000astage, the growth of the scientific interest of a new specific field (as can be\u000ameasured by publication numbers) basically follows the classical logistic\u000agrowth curve. At a second stage, starting at a later trigger time, the\u000atechnological development based on that scientific idea (as can be measured by\u000apatent deposits) can be described as the integral (in a mathematical sense) of\u000athe first curve, since technology is based on the overall accumulated\u000ascientific knowledge. The model is tested through a bibliometric analysis of\u000athe publication and patent deposit rate for Organic Light Emitting Diodes\u000a(OLED) scientific research and technology, as well as for other emerging\u000atechnologies.

VThe Web is our primary source of all kinds of information today. This\u000aincludes information about software as well as associated materials, like\u000asource code, documentation, related publications and change logs. Such data is\u000aof particular importance in research in order to conduct, comprehend and\u000areconstruct scientific experiments that involve software. swMATH, a\u000amathematical software directory, attempts to identify software mentions in\u000ascientific articles and provides additional information as well as links to the\u000aWeb. However, just like software itself, the Web is dynamic and most likely the\u000ainformation on the Web has changed since it was referenced in a scientific\u000apublication. Therefore, it is crucial to preserve the resources of a software\u000aon the Web to capture its states over time.\u000a  We found that around 40% of the websites in swMATH are already included in an\u000aexisting Web archive. Out of these, 60% of contain some kind of documentation\u000aand around 45% even provide downloads of software artifacts. Hence, already\u000atoday links can be established based on the publication dates of corresponding\u000aarticles. The contained data enable enriching existing information with a\u000atemporal dimension.

This paper details the evolution of\u000aone important digital library component as it has grown in functionality and\u000ausefulness over several years of use by a live, unrestricted community. Central\u000ato its evolution have been user studies, analysis of use patterns, and\u000aformative usability evaluation. We extrapolate that all three components are\u000anecessary in the production of successful digital library systems.

VQuantization becomes a new way to study classical game theory since quantum\u000astrategies and quantum games have been proposed. In previous studies, many\u000atypical game models, such as prisoner's dilemma, battle of the sexes, Hawk-Dove\u000agame, have been investigated by using quantization approaches. In this paper,\u000aseveral game models of opinion formations have been quantized based on the\u000aMarinatto-Weber quantum game scheme, a frequently used scheme to convert\u000aclassical games to quantum versions. Our results show that the quantization can\u000achange fascinatingly the properties of some classical opinion formation game\u000amodels so as to generate win-win outcomes.

While the\u000abenefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks\u000ato our society. After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated.

VCurrent security model in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\u000apredominantly use symmetric key cryptography. The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\u000asymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\u000aadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VThis paper investigates the problem of implementing proportionate-type LMS\u000afamily of algorithms in hardware for sparse adaptive filtering applications\u000aespecially the network echo cancelation. We derive a re-formulated\u000aproportionate type algorithm through algorithm-architecture co-design\u000amethodology that can be pipelined and has an efficient architecture for\u000ahardware implementation. We study the convergence, steady-state and tracking\u000aperformances of these re-formulated algorithms for white, color and speech\u000ainputs before implementing them in hardware. To the best of our knowledge this\u000ais the first attempt to implement proportionate-type algorithms in hardware.

VNowadays, graph databases are employed when relationships between entities\u000aare in the scope of database queries to avoid performance-critical join\u000aoperations of relational databases. Graph queries are used to query and modify\u000agraphs stored in graph databases. Graph queries employ graph pattern matching\u000athat is NP-complete for subgraph isomorphism. Graph database views can be\u000aemployed that keep ready answers in terms of precalculated graph pattern\u000amatches for often stated and complex graph queries to increase query\u000aperformance. However, such graph database views must be kept consistent with\u000athe graphs stored in the graph database.\u000a  In this paper, we describe how to use incremental graph pattern matching as\u000atechnique for maintaining graph database views. We present an incremental\u000amaintenance algorithm for graph database views, which works for imperatively\u000aand declaratively specified graph queries. The evaluation shows that our\u000amaintenance algorithm scales when the number of nodes and edges stored in the\u000agraph database increases. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our approach\u000acan outperform existing approaches for the incremental maintenance of graph\u000aquery results.

VProbabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability\u000atheory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified\u000adescription of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical\u000amodel. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful\u000aproperties:\u000a  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the\u000astructures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to\u000adesign and motivate new models.\u000a  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the\u000amodel, including the conditional independence properties.\u000a  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning\u000ain sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations,\u000ain which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\u000a  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including\u000abioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing\u000aanalysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models\u000aremains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over\u000athe space of all possible structures.\u000a  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure\u000alearning algorithms.

VWhich topics of machine learning are most commonly addressed in research?\u000aThis question was initially answered in 2007 by doing a qualitative survey\u000aamong distinguished researchers. In our study, we revisit this question from a\u000aquantitative perspective. Concretely, we collect 54K abstracts of papers\u000apublished between 2007 and 2016 in leading machine learning journals and\u000aconferences. We then use machine learning in order to determine the top 10\u000atopics in machine learning. We not only include models, but provide a holistic\u000aview across optimization, data, features, etc. This quantitative approach\u000aallows reducing the bias of surveys. It reveals new and up-to-date insights\u000ainto what the 10 most prolific topics in machine learning research are. This\u000aallows researchers to identify popular topics as well as new and rising topics\u000afor their research.

VThree approaches to content-and-structure XML retrieval are analysed in this\u000apaper: first by using Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; second\u000aby using eXist, a native XML database, and third by using a hybrid XML\u000aretrieval system that uses eXist to produce the final answers from likely\u000arelevant articles retrieved by Zettair. INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics\u000acan be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as\u000afinal answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles\u000aas final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid\u000asystem improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For\u000aranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval\u000amodel that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of\u000aa native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements. The final\u000aresults of our experiments show that when the XML retrieval task focusses on\u000ahighly relevant elements our hybrid XML retrieval system with the Coherent\u000aRetrieval Elements module is 1.8 times more effective than Zettair and 3 times\u000amore effective than eXist, and yields an effective content-and-structure XML\u000aretrieval.

VClustering problems have numerous applications and are becoming more\u000achallenging as the size of the data increases. In this paper, we consider\u000adesigning clustering algorithms that can be used in MapReduce, the most popular\u000aprogramming environment for processing large datasets. We focus on the\u000apractical and popular clustering problems, $k$-center and $k$-median. We\u000adevelop fast clustering algorithms with constant factor approximation\u000aguarantees. From a theoretical perspective, we give the first analysis that\u000ashows several clustering algorithms are in $\u005cmathcal{MRC}^0$, a theoretical\u000aMapReduce class introduced by Karloff et al. \u005ccite{KarloffSV10}. Our algorithms\u000ause sampling to decrease the data size and they run a time consuming clustering\u000aalgorithm such as local search or Lloyd's algorithm on the resulting data set.\u000aOur algorithms have sufficient flexibility to be used in practice since they\u000arun in a constant number of MapReduce rounds. We complement these results by\u000aperforming experiments using our algorithms. We compare the empirical\u000aperformance of our algorithms to several sequential and parallel algorithms for\u000athe $k$-median problem. The experiments show that our algorithms' solutions are\u000asimilar to or better than the other algorithms' solutions. Furthermore, on data\u000asets that are sufficiently large, our algorithms are faster than the other\u000aparallel algorithms that we tested.

The\u000aproposed system helps in identifying data types, choosing a machine learn- ing\u000amodel, tuning hyper-parameters, avoiding over-fitting and optimization for a\u000aprovided evaluation metric.

VMemory trace analysis is an important technology for architecture research,\u000asystem software (i.e., OS, compiler) optimization, and application performance\u000aimprovements. Hardware-snooping is an effective and efficient approach to\u000amonitor and collect memory traces. Compared with software-based approaches,\u000amemory traces collected by hardware-based approaches are usually lack of\u000asemantic information, such as process/function/loop identifiers, virtual\u000aaddress and I/O access. In this paper we propose a hybrid hardware/software\u000amechanism which is able to collect memory reference trace as well as semantic\u000ainformation. Based on this mechanism, we designed and implemented a prototype\u000asystem called HMTT (Hybrid Memory Trace Tool) which adopts a DIMMsnooping\u000amechanism to snoop on memory bus and a software-controlled tracing mechanism to\u000ainject semantic information into normal memory trace. To the best of our\u000aknowledge, the HMTT system is the first hardware tracing system capable of\u000acorrelating memory trace with high-level events. Comprehensive validations and\u000aevaluations show that the HMTT system has both hardware's (e.g., no distortion\u000aor pollution) and software's advantages (e.g., flexibility and more\u000ainformation).

VDifferent mathematical models of recognition processes are known. In the\u000apresent paper we consider a pattern recognition algorithm as an oracle\u000acomputation on a Turing machine. Such point of view seems to be useful in\u000apattern recognition as well as in recursion theory. Use of recursion theory in\u000apattern recognition shows connection between a recognition algorithm comparison\u000aproblem and complexity problems of oracle computation. That is because in many\u000acases we can take into account only the number of sign computations or in other\u000awords volume of oracle information needed. Therefore, the problem of\u000arecognition algorithm preference can be formulated as a complexity optimization\u000aproblem of oracle computation. Furthermore, introducing a certain "natural"\u000apreference relation on a set of recognizing algorithms, we discover it to be\u000anontransitive. This relates to the well known nontransitivity paradox in\u000aprobability theory.\u000a  Keywords: Pattern Recognition, Recursion Theory, Nontransitivity, Preference\u000aRelation

VThis study proposes a new router architecture to improve the performance of\u000adynamic allocation of virtual channels. The proposed router is designed to\u000areduce the hardware complexity and to improve power and area consumption,\u000asimultaneously. In the new structure of the proposed router, all of the\u000acontrolling components have been implemented sequentially inside the allocator\u000arouter modules. This optimizes communications between the controlling\u000acomponents and eliminates the most of hardware overloads of modular\u000acommunications. Eliminating additional communications also reduces the hardware\u000acomplexity. In order to show the validity of the proposed design in real\u000ahardware resources, the proposed router has been implemented onto a\u000aField-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Since the implementation of a\u000aNetwork-on-Chip (NoC) requires certain amount of area on the chip, the\u000asuggested approach is also able to reduce the demand of hardware resources. In\u000athis method, the internal memory of the FPGA is used for implementing control\u000aunits. This memory is faster and can be used with specific patterns. The use of\u000athe FPGA memory saves the hardware resources and allows the implementation of\u000aNoC based FPGA.

VDatabases, collections of related data, are as old as the written word. A\u000adatabase can be anything from a homemaker's metal recipe file to a\u000asophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we\u000ainvariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management\u000asystems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box\u000aor cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How\u000adid the computerized database evolve?\u000a  This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the\u000adatabase, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now\u000astandard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early\u000acomputerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed\u000aSequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage\u000amethods. Early database models are explored including the network and\u000ahierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and\u000aobject-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams,\u000aincluding hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity\u000arelationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to\u000asupport the text.\u000a  This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS\u000adevelopment. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into\u000athe relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented\u000adevelopment methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS.

VWith the imminent slowing down of DRAM scaling, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is\u000aemerging as a lead alternative for main memory technology. While PCM achieves\u000alow energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly\u000aslower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before\u000awearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware\u000acache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual\u000acaching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware\u000acaches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce\u000aresources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and\u000aremoving such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and\u000acomplexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We\u000apropose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on\u000ademand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as\u000aMigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth,\u000aand wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis.\u000aSecond, to reduce the software overhead of good replacement policies, we\u000apropose recently- accessed-page-id (RAPid) buffer, a hardware buffer to track\u000athe addresses of recently-accessed MigrantStore pages.

VRecently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases\u000awith pathological size. For example, experiments in genome biology usually\u000aprovide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects\u000a(experiments). In this case, mining the "transposed" database runs through a\u000asmaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed\u000apatterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining\u000afor those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and\u000aconstraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition\u000aand look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating\u000athe closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint,\u000astarting from those mined in the "transposed" database. Finally, we show how to\u000agenerate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones.

Approaches that are of specific\u000arelevance to the digital library community include the Metadata Encoding and\u000aTransmission Standard (METS), the IMS Content Packaging XML Binding, and the\u000aXML Formatted Data Units (XFDU) developed by CCSDS Panel 2.

This article gives a brief insight\u000ainto the MPEG-21 standardization effort, highlights the major characteristics\u000aof the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model, and describes the MPEG-21 Digital Item\u000aDeclaration Language (MPEG-21 DIDL), an XML syntax for the representation of\u000adigital assets based on the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model.

VAn ERP is a kind of package which consist front end and backend as DBMS like\u000aa collection of DBMSs. You can create DBMS to manage one aspect of your\u000abusiness. For example, a publishing house has a database of books that keeps\u000ainformation about books such as Author Name, Title, Translator Name, etc. But\u000athis database app only helps enter books data and search them. It doesn't help\u000athem, for example, sell books. They get or develop another DBMS database that\u000ahas all the Books data plus prices, discount formulas, names of common clients,\u000aetc. Now they connect the Books database to Sales database and maybe also the\u000ainventory database. Now its DBMS slowly turning into an ERP. They may add\u000apayroll database and connect it to this ERP. They may develop sales staff and\u000acommissions database and connect it to this ERP and so on. In the traditional\u000aDatabase management system the different databases are used for the various\u000aCampuses of the JSPM Group of Education like Wagholi Campus, Tathwade Campus,\u000aNarhe Campus, Hadpsar Campuses, Bhavdhan Campus as well as Corporate office at\u000aKatraj of same organization so it is not possible to keep different databases\u000afor the same so in this paper proposed the use of Integrated Database for the\u000aEntire organization using ERP system. The Proposed ERP system applied on the\u000aexisting Architecture of the JSPM Group; the marginal difference observed in\u000athe Databases need to be accessed to generate the same number of Reports when\u000ause the Traditional DBMS which end up with improvement in the Functional\u000aefficiency of Organizational Architecture.

VIn a given space of models or hypothesis the individual information content\u000aof each of them is considered as opposed to the Shannon entropy that measures\u000athe average information content of the mentioned space. In particular\u000aexpressing Bayes Theorem in terms of the information contents associated to its\u000aprobabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the\u000asystem by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space.\u000aIt is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information\u000asources are generated: the Information Content Associated to the Evidence that\u000aalways introduces positive information, and the Information Content Associated\u000ato the Bayes Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the\u000aevidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and\u000athe likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference\u000abetween these two mentioned information contents, the information that arrives\u000ato a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric,\u000agiven by the difference of the two mentioned information contents called\u000atransfer information content which measures the information transferred to each\u000aof the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem\u000a(MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed\u000aallows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the\u000acounterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information.\u000aThe implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to\u000athe emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience\u000a(particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding) are proposed as\u000afurther work.

We derive model-specific data aggregation and\u000adisaggregation procedures. We also show optimality, convergence, and the\u000aoptimality gap of the approximated solution in each iteration.

VTheoretical frameworks like the Probability Ranking Principle and its more\u000arecent Interactive Information Retrieval variant have guided the development of\u000aranking and retrieval algorithms for decades, yet they are not capable of\u000ahelping us model problems in Dynamic Information Retrieval which exhibit the\u000afollowing three properties; an observable user signal, retrieval over multiple\u000astages and an overall search intent. In this paper a new theoretical framework\u000afor retrieval in these scenarios is proposed. We derive a general dynamic\u000autility function for optimizing over these types of tasks, that takes into\u000aaccount the utility of each stage and the probability of observing user\u000afeedback. We apply our framework to experiments over TREC data in the dynamic\u000amulti page search scenario as a practical demonstration of its effectiveness\u000aand to frame the discussion of its use, its limitations and to compare it\u000aagainst the existing frameworks.

VProcess-Aware Information System (PAIS) are IT systems that manages, supports\u000abusiness processes and generate large event logs from execution of business\u000aprocesses. An event log is represented as a tuple of the form CaseID,\u000aTimeStamp, Activity and Actor. Process Mining is an emerging area of research\u000athat deals with the study and analysis of business processes based on event\u000alogs. Process Mining aims at analyzing event logs and discover business process\u000amodels, enhance them or check for conformance with an a priori model. The large\u000avolume of event logs generated are stored in databases. Relational databases\u000aperform well for certain class of applications. However, there are certain\u000aclass of applications for which relational databases are not able to scale. A\u000anumber of NoSQL databases have emerged to encounter the challenges of\u000ascalability. Discovering social network from event logs is one of the most\u000achallenging and important Process Mining task. Similar-Task and Sub-Contract\u000aalgorithms are some of the most widely used Organizational Mining techniques.\u000aOur objective is to investigate which of the databases (Relational or Graph)\u000aperform better for Organizational Mining under Process Mining. An intersection\u000aof Process Mining and Graph Databases can be accomplished by modelling these\u000aOrganizational Mining metrics with graph databases. We implement Similar-Task\u000aand Sub-Contract algorithms on relational and NoSQL (graph-oriented) databases\u000ausing only query language constructs. We conduct empirical analysis on a large\u000areal world data set to compare the performance of row-oriented database and\u000aNoSQL graph-oriented database. We benchmark performance factors like query\u000aexecution time, CPU usage and disk/memory space usage for NoSQL graph-oriented\u000adatabase against row-oriented database.

Findings from 72\u000afaculty members revealed an overall positive stance toward technology in the\u000aclassroom and the average faculty member utilized about six technology tools in\u000atheir courses. The opportunities, barriers and future uses for technologies in\u000athe higher education classroom emerged from the open-ended questions on the\u000asurvey. One finding of particular concern is that faculty are fearful that\u000atechnology causes a loss of the humanistic perspective in education.

VAccumulating evidence indicates that the capacity to integrate information in\u000athe brain is a prerequisite for consciousness. Integrated Information Theory\u000a(IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the\u000ainformation integrated in a system, called integrated information, $\u005cPhi$.\u000aIntegrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a\u000asystem generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of\u000ainformation its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of\u000aintegrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness.\u000aEmpirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated information\u000afrom neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with using\u000athe original measure $\u005cPhi$ precludes such computations. Although some\u000apractical measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures\u000afail to satisfy the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated\u000ainformation. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and\u000aupper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0\u000awhen the system does not generate information (no information) or when the\u000asystem comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of\u000aintegrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole\u000asystem and is realized when the amount of information generated independently\u000aby its parts equals to 0. Here we derive the novel practical measure $\u005cPhi^*$\u000aby introducing a concept of mismatched decoding developed from information\u000atheory. We show that $\u005cPhi^*$ is properly bounded from below and above, as\u000arequired, as a measure of integrated information. We derive the analytical\u000aexpression $\u005cPhi^*$ under the Gaussian assumption, which makes it readily\u000aapplicable to experimental data.

VEmail Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user\u000aretrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query. Up to our knowledge,\u000aexisting email retrieval ranking approaches sort the retrieved emails based on\u000asome heuristic rules, which are either search clues or some predefined user\u000acriteria rooted in email fields. Unfortunately, the user usually does not know\u000athe effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper\u000apresents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It\u000aranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial\u000aemail fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an\u000aarchitecture to allow every user in a network/group of users to be able, if\u000apermissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in\u000ahis submitted query words.

VVarious models of the information society have been developed so far and they\u000aare so different from country to country that it would be rather unwise to look\u000afor a single, allencompassing definition. In our time a number of profound\u000asocioeconomic changes are underway. The application of these theories and\u000aschools on ICT is problematic in many respects. First, as we stated above,\u000athere is not a single, widely used paradigm which has synthesised the various\u000aschools and theories dealing with technology and society. Second, these\u000afragmented approaches do not have a fully fledged mode of application to the\u000arelationship of ICT and (information) society. Third, SCOT, ANT, the\u000aevolutionary or the systems approach to the history of technology when dealing\u000awith information society does not take into account the results of approaches\u000astudying the very essence of the information age: information, communication\u000aand knowledge.

The obverse side of\u000athis exponential nature of quantum information is that the computational\u000acomplexity of implementing unconditionally reliable quantum gates is also\u000aexponential.

Besides this survey, our main original result is the following\u000acharacterization of the computably enumerable sets with trivial initial segment\u000aprefix-free complexity.

VMost existing models for multilingual natural language processing (NLP) treat\u000alanguage as a discrete category, and make predictions for either one language\u000aor the other. In contrast, we propose using continuous vector representations\u000aof language. We show that these can be learned efficiently with a\u000acharacter-based neural language model, and used to improve inference about\u000alanguage varieties not seen during training. In experiments with 1303 Bible\u000atranslations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity\u000aof multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors\u000acapture genetic relationships between languages.

VThis paper examines the use of scientometric overlay mapping as a tool of\u000a'strategic intelligence' to aid the governance of emerging technologies. We\u000adevelop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and\u000aassociated perspectives on technological emergence across the geographical,\u000asocial, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyse (with\u000apublication and patent data) three case-studies of emerging technologies in the\u000amedical domain. These are: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)\u000atesting technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase\u000a(TPMT) genetic testing. Given the flexibility (i.e. adaptability to different\u000asources of data) and granularity (i.e. applicability across multiple levels of\u000adata aggregation) of overlay mapping techniques, we argue that these techniques\u000acan favour the integration and comparison of results from different contexts\u000aand cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a 'distributed'\u000astrategic intelligence for analysts and decision-makers.

VWe introduce an agent-based model for the spreading of technological\u000adevelopments in socio-economic systems where the technology is mainly used for\u000athe collaboration/interaction of agents. Agents use products of different\u000atechnologies to collaborate with each other which induce costs proportional to\u000athe difference of technological levels. Additional costs arise when\u000atechnologies of different providers are used. Agents can adopt technologies and\u000aproviders of their interacting partners in order to reduce their costs leading\u000ato microscopic rearrangements of the system. Analytical calculations and\u000acomputer simulations revealed that starting from a random configuration of\u000adifferent technological levels a complex time evolution emerges where the\u000aspreading of advanced technologies and the overall technological progress of\u000athe system are determined by the amount of advantages more advanced\u000atechnologies provide, and by the structure of the social environment of agents.\u000aWe show that agents tend to form clusters of identical technological level with\u000aa power law size distribution. When technological progress arises, the\u000aspreading of technologies in the system can be described by extreme order\u000astatistics.

VIn this paper, we consider the phase retrieval problem in which one aims to\u000arecover a signal from the magnitudes of affine measurements. Let $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m \u005csubset {\u005cmathbb H}^d$ and ${\u005cmathbf b}=(b_1, \u005cldots,\u000ab_m)^\u005ctop\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^m$, where ${\u005cmathbb H}={\u005cmathbb R}$ or ${\u005cmathbb C}$.\u000aWe say $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf a}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ are affine phase retrievable\u000afor ${\u005cmathbb H}^d$ if any ${\u005cmathbf x}\u005cin{\u005cmathbb H}^d$ can be recovered from\u000athe magnitudes of the affine measurements $\u005c{|<{\u005cmathbf a}_j,{\u005cmathbf\u000ax}>+b_j|,\u005c, 1\u005cleq j\u005cleq m\u005c}$. We develop general framework for affine phase\u000aretrieval and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ to be affine phase retrievable. We establish\u000aresults on minimal measurements and generic measurements for affine phase\u000aretrieval as well as on sparse affine phase retrieval. In particular, we also\u000ahighlight some notable differences between affine phase retrieval and the\u000astandard phase retrieval in which one aims to recover a signal $\u005cmathbf x$ from\u000athe magnitudes of its linear measurements. In standard phase retrieval, one can\u000aonly recover $\u005cmathbf x$ up to a unimodular constant, while affine phase\u000aretrieval removes this ambiguity. We prove that unlike standard phase\u000aretrieval, the affine phase retrievable measurements $\u005c{{\u005cmathbf\u000aa}_j\u005c}_{j=1}^m$ and $\u005cmathbf b$ do not form an open set in ${\u005cmathbb\u000aH}^{m\u005ctimes d}\u005ctimes {\u005cmathbb H}^m$. Also in the complex setting, the standard\u000aphase retrieval requires $4d-O(\u005clog_2d)$ measurements, while the affine phase\u000aretrieval only needs $m=3d$ measurements.

VLanguage segmentation consists in finding the boundaries where one language\u000aends and another language begins in a text written in more than one language.\u000aThis is important for all natural language processing tasks. The problem can be\u000asolved by training language models on language data. However, in the case of\u000alow- or no-resource languages, this is problematic. I therefore investigate\u000awhether unsupervised methods perform better than supervised methods when it is\u000adifficult or impossible to train supervised approaches. A special focus is\u000agiven to difficult texts, i.e. texts that are rather short (one sentence),\u000acontaining abbreviations, low-resource languages and non-standard language. I\u000acompare three approaches: supervised n-gram language models, unsupervised\u000aclustering and weakly supervised n-gram language model induction. I devised the\u000aweakly supervised approach in order to deal with difficult text specifically.\u000aIn order to test the approach, I compiled a small corpus of different text\u000atypes, ranging from one-sentence texts to texts of about 300 words. The weakly\u000asupervised language model induction approach works well on short and difficult\u000atexts, outperforming the clustering algorithm and reaching scores in the\u000avicinity of the supervised approach. The results look promising, but there is\u000aroom for improvement and a more thorough investigation should be undertaken.

VThe importance of security in database research has greatly increased over\u000athe years as most of critical functionality of the business and military\u000aenterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information\u000asystem and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on\u000aphysical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be\u000acompromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading\u000aavailability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology\u000aenvironment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database\u000aresearch community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to\u000athe database security. The database research community has thoughts about these\u000aissues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will\u000aexamine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the\u000aadaption of the research to the changing environment. Some short term database\u000aresearch trends will be ascertained at the conclusion.

VKeyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent\u000ayears because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured\u000aquery language nor to know the complex underlying database schemas. Most of\u000aexisting methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static\u000adatabases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users\u000amay have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation,\u000ait is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in a database system\u000ato support continual keyword queries.\u000a  In this paper, we propose an efficient method for answering continual top-$k$\u000akeyword queries over relational databases. The proposed method is built on an\u000aexisting scheme of keyword search on relational data streams, but incorporates\u000athe ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two\u000aimprovements to support efficient top-$k$ keyword search in relational\u000adatabases. Compared to the existing methods, our method is more efficient both\u000ain computing the top-$k$ results in a static database and in maintaining the\u000atop-$k$ results when the database continually being updated. Experimental\u000aresults validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

VAs machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of\u000ainterest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation\u000afor their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess\u000aother criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the\u000ainterest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what\u000ainterpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this\u000aposition paper, we first define interpretability and describe when\u000ainterpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy\u000afor rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous\u000ascience of interpretable machine learning.

VThere is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel\u000atechnologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of\u000astudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\u000aconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\u000adesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\u000aaims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\u000alinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\u000aoperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\u000acombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\u000a'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\u000aissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\u000aattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\u000aradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\u000aimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\u000aemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\u000aattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\u000ain, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\u000astudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\u000acitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\u000aand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\u000aattributes of emergence.

VValence automata are a generalization of various models of automata with\u000astorage. Here, each edge carries, in addition to an input word, an element of a\u000amonoid. A computation is considered valid if multiplying the monoid elements on\u000athe visited edges yields the identity element. By choosing suitable monoids, a\u000avariety of automata models can be obtained as special valence automata.\u000a  This work is concerned with the accepting power of valence automata.\u000aSpecifically, we ask for which monoids valence automata can accept only\u000acontext-free languages or only languages with semilinear Parikh image,\u000arespectively.\u000a  First, we present a characterization of those graph products (of monoids) for\u000awhich valence automata accept only context-free languages. Second, we provide a\u000anecessary and sufficient condition for a graph product of copies of the\u000abicyclic monoid and the integers to yield only languages with semilinear Parikh\u000aimage when used as a storage mechanism in valence automata. Third, we show that\u000aall languages accepted by valence automata over torsion groups have a\u000asemilinear Parikh image.

VIntegrals related to the surface area of arbitrary ellipsoids are derived,\u000aevaluated, and compared with each other and existing integrals found in the\u000aliterature. We clarify the literature on the ellipsoid area problem, which\u000adates back to Legendre's original 1811 work. We derive and evaluate several\u000aadditional integrals involving or evaluating to elliptic integrals. These new\u000aintegrals are natural extensions of those found in the literature and\u000aconstitute useful additions to standard integrals compendia.

VThe computational complexity analysis of genetic programming (GP) has been\u000astarted recently by analyzing simple (1+1) GP algorithms for the problems ORDER\u000aand MAJORITY. In this paper, we study how taking the complexity as an\u000aadditional criteria influences the runtime behavior. We consider\u000ageneralizations of ORDER and MAJORITY and present a computational complexity\u000aanalysis of (1+1) GP using multi-criteria fitness functions that take into\u000aaccount the original objective and the complexity of a syntax tree as a\u000asecondary measure. Furthermore, we study the expected time until\u000apopulation-based multi-objective genetic programming algorithms have computed\u000athe Pareto front when taking the complexity of a syntax tree as an equally\u000aimportant objective.

VWe create a new two-player game on the Sperner Triangle based on Sperner's\u000alemma. Our game has simple rules and several desirable properties. First, the\u000agame is always certain to have a winner. Second, like many other interesting\u000agames such as Hex and Geography, we prove that deciding whether one can win our\u000agame is a PSPACE-complete problem. Third, there is an elegant balance in the\u000agame such that neither the first nor the second player always has a decisive\u000aadvantage. We provide a web-based version of the game, playable at:\u000ahttp://cs-people.bu.edu/paithan/spernerGame/ . In addition we propose other\u000agames, also based on fixed-point theorems.

VWe contribute to the theory for minimal liftings of cut-generating functions.\u000aIn particular, we give three operations that preserve the so-called covering\u000aproperty of certain structured cut-generating functions. This has the\u000aconsequence of vastly expanding the set of undominated cut generating functions\u000awhich can be used computationally, compared to known examples from the\u000aliterature. The results of this paper are significant generalizations of\u000aprevious results from the literature on such operations, and also use\u000acompletely different proof techniques which we feel are more suitable for\u000aattacking future research questions in this area.

VMost languages use the relative order between words to encode meaning\u000arelations. Languages differ, however, in what orders they use and how these\u000aorders are mapped onto different meanings. We test the hypothesis that, despite\u000athese differences, human languages might constitute different `solutions' to\u000acommon pressures of language use. Using Monte Carlo simulations over data from\u000afive languages, we find that their word orders are efficient for processing in\u000aterms of both dependency length and local lexical probability. This suggests\u000athat biases originating in how the brain understands language strongly\u000aconstrain how human languages change over generations.

VSpecific to Math Information Retrieval is combining text with mathematical\u000aformulae both in documents and in queries. Rigorous evaluation of query\u000aexpansion and merging strategies combining math and standard textual keyword\u000aterms in a query are given. It is shown that techniques similar to those known\u000afrom textual query processing may be applied in math information retrieval as\u000awell, and lead to a cutting edge performance. Striping and merging partial\u000aresults from subqueries is one technique that improves results measured by\u000ainformation retrieval evaluation metrics like Bpref.

VOur results demonstrated that a previously reported protein name\u000aco-occurrence method (5-mention PubGene) which was not based on a hypothesis\u000atesting framework, it is generally statistically more significant than the 99th\u000apercentile of Poisson distribution-based method of calculating co-occurrence.\u000aIt agrees with previous methods using natural language processing to extract\u000aprotein-protein interaction from text as more than 96% of the interactions\u000afound by natural language processing methods to overlap with the results from\u000a5-mention PubGene method. However, less than 2% of the gene co-expressions\u000aanalyzed by microarray were found from direct co-occurrence or interaction\u000ainformation extraction from the literature. At the same time, combining\u000amicroarray and literature analyses, we derive a novel set of 7 potential\u000afunctional protein-protein interactions that had not been previously described\u000ain the literature.

VConstructing ontologies from relational databases is an active research topic\u000ain the Semantic Web domain. While conceptual mapping rules/principles of\u000arelational databases and ontology structures are being proposed, several\u000asoftware modules or plug-ins are being developed to enable the automatic\u000aconversion of relational databases into ontologies. However, the correlation\u000abetween the resulting ontologies built automatically with plug-ins from\u000arelational databases and the database-to-ontology mapping principles has been\u000agiven little attention. This study reviews and applies two Prot\u005c'eg\u005c'e\u000aplug-ins, namely, DataMaster and OntoBase to automatically construct ontologies\u000afrom a relational database. The resulting ontologies are further analysed to\u000amatch their structures against the database-to-ontology mapping principles. A\u000acomparative analysis of the matching results reveals that OntoBase outperforms\u000aDataMaster in applying the database-to-ontology mapping principles for\u000aautomatically converting relational databases into ontologies.
