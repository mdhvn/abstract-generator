VArtificial Intelligence for Conflict Management
p20

VMilitarised conflict is one of the risks that have a significant impact on\u000asociety. Militarised Interstate Dispute (MID) is defined as an outcome of\u000ainterstate interactions, which result on either peace or conflict. Effective\u000aprediction of the possibility of conflict between states is an important\u000adecision support tool for policy makers. In a previous research, neural\u000anetworks (NNs) have been implemented to predict the MID. Support Vector\u000aMachines (SVMs) have proven to be very good prediction techniques and are\u000aintroduced for the prediction of MIDs in this study and compared to neural\u000anetworks. The results show that SVMs predict MID better than NNs while NNs give\u000amore consistent and easy to interpret sensitivity analysis than SVMs.

VAI Researchers, Video Games Are Your Friends!

VIf you are an artificial intelligence researcher, you should look to video\u000agames as ideal testbeds for the work you do. If you are a video game developer,\u000ayou should look to AI for the technology that makes completely new types of\u000agames possible. This chapter lays out the case for both of these propositions.\u000aIt asks the question "what can video games do for AI", and discusses how in\u000aparticular general video game playing is the ideal testbed for artificial\u000ageneral intelligence research. It then asks the question "what can AI do for\u000avideo games", and lays out a vision for what video games might look like if we\u000ahad significantly more advanced AI at our disposal. The chapter is based on my\u000akeynote at IJCCI 2015, and is written in an attempt to be accessible to a broad\u000aaudience.

This combination model includes\u000aadditive and multiplicative elements, which allows to incorporate new\u000aproperties, which enhance the action selection. A given parameter a, which is\u000apart of the proposed model, allows to regulate the degree of dependence of the\u000aobserved external behaviour from the internal states of the entity.

VThis paper presents a tutorial for network anomaly detection, focusing on\u000anon-signature-based approaches. Network traffic anomalies are unusual and\u000asignificant changes in the traffic of a network. Networks play an important\u000arole in today's social and economic infrastructures. The security of the\u000anetwork becomes crucial, and network traffic anomaly detection constitutes an\u000aimportant part of network security. In this paper, we present three major\u000aapproaches to non-signature-based network detection: PCA-based, sketch-based,\u000aand signal-analysis-based. In addition, we introduce a framework that subsumes\u000athe three approaches and a scheme for network anomaly extraction. We believe\u000anetwork anomaly detection will become more important in the future because of\u000athe increasing importance of network security.

VA Compiler for Ordered Logic Programs
p61
sS'summary'
p62
VThis paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic\u000aprograms into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an\u000aordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among\u000arules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is\u000atransformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the\u000apreferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed\u000atheory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since\u000athe result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic\u000aprogramming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular,\u000aPLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and\u000asmodels.

VHeterogeneous knowledge representation using a finite automaton and\u000a  first order logic: a case study in electromyography

VIn a certain number of situations, human cognitive functioning is difficult\u000ato represent with classical artificial intelligence structures. Such a\u000adifficulty arises in the polyneuropathy diagnosis which is based on the spatial\u000adistribution, along the nerve fibres, of lesions, together with the synthesis\u000aof several partial diagnoses. Faced with this problem while building up an\u000aexpert system (NEUROP), we developed a heterogeneous knowledge representation\u000aassociating a finite automaton with first order logic. A number of knowledge\u000arepresentation problems raised by the electromyography test features are\u000aexamined in this study and the expert system architecture allowing such a\u000aknowledge modeling are laid out.

VArtificial Intelligence and Asymmetric Information Theory
p72
sg7
VWhen human agents come together to make decisions, it is often the case that\u000aone human agent has more information than the other. This phenomenon is called\u000ainformation asymmetry and this distorts the market. Often if one human agent\u000aintends to manipulate a decision in its favor the human agent can signal wrong\u000aor right information. Alternatively, one human agent can screen for information\u000ato reduce the impact of asymmetric information on decisions. With the advent of\u000aartificial intelligence, signaling and screening have been made easier. This\u000apaper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric\u000ainformation. It is surmised that artificial intelligent agents reduce the\u000adegree of information asymmetry and thus the market where these agents are\u000adeployed become more efficient. It is also postulated that the more artificial\u000aintelligent agents there are deployed in the market the less is the volume of\u000atrades in the market. This is because for many trades to happen the asymmetry\u000aof information on goods and services to be traded should exist, creating a\u000asense of arbitrage.

VPredicting Social Status via Social Networks: A Case Study on\u000a  University, Occupation, and Region
p84
sS'summary'
p85
VSocial status refers to the relative position within the society. It is an\u000aimportant notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring\u000asocial status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed\u000ato assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment,\u000aoccupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes\u000adifficult to collect or measure.\u000a  We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status.\u000aOnline activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are\u000ainterested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social\u000astatus can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge,\u000athis is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in\u000areality.\u000a  In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study.\u000aA user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted\u000asocial status of users to the "status" of real-world entities, e.g.,\u000auniversities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate\u000apredicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient\u000aalgorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million\u000ausers from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social\u000astatus with reasonable accuracy using social network data. We also point out\u000achallenges and limitations of this approach, e.g., inconsistence between online\u000apopularity and real-world status for certain users. Our findings provide\u000ainsights on analyzing online social status and future designs of ranking\u000aschemes for social networks.

VProbability Judgement in Artificial Intelligence
p90
sg7
VThis paper is concerned with two theories of probability judgment: the\u000aBayesian theory and the theory of belief functions. It illustrates these\u000atheories with some simple examples and discusses some of the issues that arise\u000awhen we try to implement them in expert systems. The Bayesian theory is well\u000aknown; its main ideas go back to the work of Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). The\u000atheory of belief functions, often called the Dempster-Shafer theory in the\u000aartificial intelligence community, is less well known, but it has even older\u000aantecedents; belief-function arguments appear in the work of George Hooper\u000a(16401723) and James Bernoulli (1654-1705). For elementary expositions of the\u000atheory of belief functions, see Shafer (1976, 1985).

VRealizing an optimization approach inspired from Piagets theory on\u000a  cognitive development
p118
sg7
VThe objective of this paper is to introduce an artificial intelligence based\u000aoptimization approach, which is inspired from Piagets theory on cognitive\u000adevelopment. The approach has been designed according to essential processes\u000athat an individual may experience while learning something new or improving his\u000a/ her knowledge. These processes are associated with the Piagets ideas on an\u000aindividuals cognitive development. The approach expressed in this paper is a\u000asimple algorithm employing swarm intelligence oriented tasks in order to\u000aovercome single-objective optimization problems. For evaluating effectiveness\u000aof this early version of the algorithm, test operations have been done via some\u000abenchmark functions. The obtained results show that the approach / algorithm\u000acan be an alternative to the literature in terms of single-objective\u000aoptimization. The authors have suggested the name: Cognitive Development\u000aOptimization Algorithm (CoDOA) for the related intelligent optimization\u000aapproach.

VDon't Fear the Reaper: Refuting Bostrom's Superintelligence Argument
p123
sg7
VIn recent years prominent intellectuals have raised ethical concerns about\u000athe consequences of artificial intelligence. One concern is that an autonomous\u000aagent might modify itself to become "superintelligent" and, in supremely\u000aeffective pursuit of poorly specified goals, destroy all of humanity. This\u000apaper considers and rejects the possibility of this outcome. We argue that this\u000ascenario depends on an agent's ability to rapidly improve its ability to\u000apredict its environment through self-modification. Using a Bayesian model of a\u000areasoning agent, we show that there are important limitations to how an agent\u000amay improve its predictive ability through self-modification alone. We conclude\u000athat concern about this artificial intelligence outcome is misplaced and better\u000adirected at policy questions around data access and storage.

This\u000asuggests a new perspective on the interpretation of Dependence Logic formulas,\u000ain terms of assertions about reachability in games of im- perfect information\u000aagainst Nature. We then capitalize on this intuition by developing expressively\u000aequivalent variants of Dependence Logic in which this interpretation is taken\u000ato the foreground.

VWe present probabilistic neural programs, a framework for program induction\u000athat permits flexible specification of both a computational model and inference\u000aalgorithm while simultaneously enabling the use of deep neural networks.\u000aProbabilistic neural programs combine a computation graph for specifying a\u000aneural network with an operator for weighted nondeterministic choice. Thus, a\u000aprogram describes both a collection of decisions as well as the neural network\u000aarchitecture used to make each one. We evaluate our approach on a challenging\u000adiagram question answering task where probabilistic neural programs correctly\u000aexecute nearly twice as many programs as a baseline model.

VInfluence Activation Model: A New Perspective in Social Influence\u000a  Analysis and Social Network Evolution
p208
sg85
VWhat drives the propensity for the social network dynamics? Social influence\u000ais believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it has\u000anot been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis\u000asuggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in\u000asocial networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity\u000a(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes and\u000abehaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of network\u000aevolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence\u000apropagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.\u000aOur experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the\u000aimportant role that social influence can play in the process of network\u000aevolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different\u000agenres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the\u000anetwork dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our\u000aunderstanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge\u000aof the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.

In this\u000apaper, we focus on measuring the performance impacts of diverse applications\u000aand scalable volumes of data sets on big data systems. For four typical data\u000aanalysis applications---an important class of big data applications, we find\u000atwo major results through experiments: first, the data scale has a significant\u000aimpact on the performance of big data systems, so we must provide scalable\u000avolumes of data sets in big data benchmarks. Second, for the four applications,\u000aeven all of them use the simple algorithms, the performance trends are\u000adifferent with increasing data scales, and hence we must consider not only\u000avariety of data sets but also variety of applications in benchmarking big data\u000asystems.

VAutonomous robots and the SP theory of intelligence
p242
sg7
VThis article is about how the "SP theory of intelligence" and its realisation\u000ain the "SP machine" (both outlined in the article) may help to solve\u000acomputer-related problems in the design of autonomous robots, meaning robots\u000athat do not depend on external intelligence or power supplies, are mobile, and\u000aare designed to exhibit as much human-like intelligence as possible. The\u000aarticle is about: how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of\u000acomputers and reduce their bulk; how to achieve human-like versatility in\u000aintelligence; and likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. The SP\u000asystem has potential for substantial gains in computational and energy\u000aefficiency and reductions in the bulkiness of computers: by reducing the size\u000aof data to be processed; by exploiting statistical information that the system\u000agathers; and via an updated version of Donald Hebb's concept of a "cell\u000aassembly". Towards human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has\u000astrengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern\u000arecognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning,\u000aproblem solving, and more, with seamless integration amongst structures and\u000afunctions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects\u000aof intelligence may help to achieve human-like adaptability in intelligence\u000avia: the learning of natural language; learning to see; building 3D models of\u000aobjects and of a robot's surroundings; learning regularities in the workings of\u000aa robot and in the robot's environment; exploration and play; learning major\u000askills; and secondary forms of learning. Also discussed are: how the SP system\u000amay process parallel streams of information; generalisation of knowledge,\u000acorrection of over-generalisations, and learning from dirty data; how to cut\u000athe cost of learning; and reinforcements, motivations, goals, and\u000ademonstration.

We illustrate the potential of exploiting internal symmetries on two\u000abenchmark domains: Van der Waerden numbers and graceful graphs. By identifying\u000ainternal symmetries we are able to extend the state of the art in both cases.

VIntelligent User Interface in Fuzzy Environment
p257

VHuman-Computer Interaction with the traditional User Interface is done using\u000aa specified in advance script dialog menu, mainly based on human intellect and\u000aunproductive use of navigation. This approach does not lead to making\u000aqualitative decision in control systems, where the situations and processes\u000acannot be structured in advance. Any dynamic changes in the controlled business\u000aprocess (as example, in organizational unit of the information fuzzy control\u000asystem) make it necessary to modify the script dialogue in User Interface. This\u000acircumstance leads to a redesign of the components of the User Interface and of\u000athe entire control system. In the Intelligent User Interface, where the dialog\u000asituations are unknown in advance, fuzzy structured and artificial intelligence\u000ais crucial, the redesign described above is impossible. To solve this and other\u000aproblems, we propose the data, information and knowledge based technology of\u000aSmart/ Intelligent User Interface (IUI) design, which interacts with users and\u000asystems in natural and other languages, utilizing the principles of Situational\u000aControl and Fuzzy Logic theories, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics,\u000aKnowledge Base technologies and others. The proposed technology of IUI design\u000ais defined by multi-agents of Situational Control and of data, information and\u000aknowledge, modelling of Fuzzy Logic Inference, Generalization, Representation\u000aand Explanation of knowledge, Planning and Decision-making, Dialog Control,\u000aReasoning and Systems Thinking, Fuzzy Control of organizational unit in\u000areal-time, fuzzy conditions, heterogeneous domains, and multi-lingual\u000acommunication under uncertainty and in Fuzzy Environment.

VIntelligence in Artificial Intelligence
p270
sg7
VThe elusive quest for intelligence in artificial intelligence prompts us to\u000aconsider that instituting human-level intelligence in systems may be (still) in\u000athe realm of utopia. In about a quarter century, we have witnessed the winter\u000aof AI (1990) being transformed and transported to the zenith of tabloid fodder\u000aabout AI (2015). The discussion at hand is about the elements that constitute\u000athe canonical idea of intelligence. The delivery of intelligence as a\u000apay-per-use-service, popping out of an app or from a shrink-wrapped software\u000adefined point solution, is in contrast to the bio-inspired view of intelligence\u000aas an outcome, perhaps formed from a tapestry of events, cross-pollinated by\u000ainstances, each with its own microcosm of experiences and learning, which may\u000anot be discrete all-or-none functions but continuous, over space and time. The\u000aenterprise world may not require, aspire or desire such an engaged solution to\u000aimprove its services for enabling digital transformation through the deployment\u000aof digital twins, for example. One might ask whether the "work-flow on\u000asteroids" version of decision support may suffice for intelligence? Are we\u000aharking back to the era of rule based expert systems? The image conjured by the\u000apublicity machines offers deep solutions with human-level AI and preposterous\u000aclaims about capturing the "brain in a box" by 2020. Even emulating insects may\u000abe difficult in terms of real progress. Perhaps we can try to focus on worms\u000a(Caenorhabditis elegans) which may be better suited for what business needs to\u000aquench its thirst for so-called intelligence in AI.

These can still be solved by a variable elimination\u000aalgorithm, leading to a set of maximal values of expected utility. If the\u000aPareto ordering is used this set can often be prohibitively large. We consider\u000aapproximate representations of the Pareto set based on e-coverings, allowing\u000amuch larger problems to be solved. In addition, we define a method for\u000aincorporating user tradeoffs, which also greatly improves the efficiency.

VPurpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a CAD-based human-robot\u000ainterface that allows non-expert users to teach a robot in a manner similar to\u000athat used by human beings to teach each other.\u000a  Design/methodology/approach - Intuitive robot programming is achieved by\u000ausing CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows\u000aminimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the\u000arobot paths during robot operation.\u000a  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from\u000aa common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or\u000aCAD model accuracy.\u000a  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has\u000ato do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular\u000atechnological applications.\u000a  Practical implications - Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages\u000ain their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to\u000aprogram robots without the need for skilled robot programmers.\u000a  Originality/value - The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming\u000asystem. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing running on a\u000acommonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a\u000acommercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD\u000aintegrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no\u000aadvanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot\u000aprograms are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot\u000alanguage.

VProbabilistic Conceptual Network: A Belief Representation Scheme for\u000a  Utility-Based Categorization
p364
sg7
VProbabilistic conceptual network is a knowledge representation scheme\u000adesigned for reasoning about concepts and categorical abstractions in\u000autility-based categorization. The scheme combines the formalisms of abstraction\u000aand inheritance hierarchies from artificial intelligence, and probabilistic\u000anetworks from decision analysis. It provides a common framework for\u000arepresenting conceptual knowledge, hierarchical knowledge, and uncertainty. It\u000afacilitates dynamic construction of categorization decision models at varying\u000alevels of abstraction. The scheme is applied to an automated machining problem\u000afor reasoning about the state of the machine at varying levels of abstraction\u000ain support of actions for maintaining competitiveness of the plant.

VHybrid Systems for Knowledge Representation in Artificial Intelligence
p374
sg7
VThere are few knowledge representation (KR) techniques available for\u000aefficiently representing knowledge. However, with the increase in complexity,\u000abetter methods are needed. Some researchers came up with hybrid mechanisms by\u000acombining two or more methods. In an effort to construct an intelligent\u000acomputer system, a primary consideration is to represent large amounts of\u000aknowledge in a way that allows effective use and efficiently organizing\u000ainformation to facilitate making the recommended inferences. There are merits\u000aand demerits of combinations, and standardized method of KR is needed. In this\u000apaper, various hybrid schemes of KR were explored at length and details\u000apresented.

In this\u000apaper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for\u000afinding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster\u000alearning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive\u000aaccuracy.

VArtificial Immune Systems Tutorial
p405
sg7
VThe biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that\u000adefends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or\u000amolecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with\u000athe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\u000afrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\u000amessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\u000asystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\u000adestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\u000ato previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\u000aremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\u000aprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\u000arecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\u000aimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\u000afrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\u000ascience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\u000aimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\u000amethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\u000aArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\u000asuch problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known\u000aalgorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will\u000around this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems\u000ais still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm\u000atemplate and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to\u000atime and from those examples given here.

VPurely Functional Structured Programming
p418
sg62
VThe idea of functional programming has played a big role in shaping today's\u000alandscape of mainstream programming languages. Another concept that dominates\u000athe current programming style is Dijkstra's structured programming. Both\u000aconcepts have been successfully married, for example in the programming\u000alanguage Scala. This paper proposes how the same can be achieved for structured\u000aprogramming and PURELY functional programming via the notion of LINEAR SCOPE.\u000aOne advantage of this proposal is that mainstream programmers can reap the\u000abenefits of purely functional programming like easily exploitable parallelism\u000awhile using familiar structured programming syntax and without knowing concepts\u000alike monads. A second advantage is that professional purely functional\u000aprogrammers can often avoid hard to read functional code by using structured\u000aprogramming syntax that is often easier to parse mentally.

VAn Approximation of the Universal Intelligence Measure
p423
sg7
VThe Universal Intelligence Measure is a recently proposed formal definition\u000aof intelligence. It is mathematically specified, extremely general, and\u000acaptures the essence of many informal definitions of intelligence. It is based\u000aon Hutter's Universal Artificial Intelligence theory, an extension of Ray\u000aSolomonoff's pioneering work on universal induction. Since the Universal\u000aIntelligence Measure is only asymptotically computable, building a practical\u000aintelligence test from it is not straightforward. This paper studies the\u000apractical issues involved in developing a real-world UIM-based performance\u000ametric. Based on our investigation, we develop a prototype implementation which\u000awe use to evaluate a number of different artificial agents.

VA proposal for ethically traceable artificial intelligence
p428

VAlthough the problem of assigning a critique of robotic behavior in\u000anear-unanimous agreement to human norms seems intractable, a starting point of\u000asuch a framework is of the collection of knowledge a priori and experience a\u000aposteriori categorized in a set of judgments available to the intelligence,\u000atranslated into computer code. If such an intersection were successful, an\u000aalgorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent equivalence to human\u000acognition is established. The process of framework development itself reveals\u000aavenues of improvement and optimization. This paper will propose the\u000aapplication of Kant's critique of reason to current perceptions of autonomous\u000aintelligent systems.

VMan and Machine: Questions of Risk, Trust and Accountability in Today's\u000a  AI Technology

But it has grown into a discipline that is deeply entwined with\u000acommerce and society. Today's AI technology, such as expert systems and\u000aintelligent assistants, pose some difficult questions of risk, trust and\u000aaccountability. In this paper, we present these concerns, examining them in the\u000acontext of historical developments that have shaped the nature and direction of\u000aAI research. We also suggest the exploration and further development of two\u000aparadigms, human intelligence-machine cooperation, and a sociological view of\u000aintelligence, which might help address some of these concerns.

VRecent technology breakthroughs have enabled data collection of unprecedented\u000ascale, rate, variety and complexity that has led to an explosion in data\u000amanagement requirements.

We endeavour to rethink the way data management\u000aresearch is being conducted and we propose to work towards modular data\u000amanagement that will allow for unification of the expression of data management\u000aproblems and systematization of their solution. The core of such an approach is\u000athe novel notion of a datom, i.e. a data management atom, which encapsulates\u000ageneric data management provision. The datom is the foundation for comparison,\u000acustomization and re-usage of data management problems and solutions.

The definitions of independence and conditional independence\u000ain VBS generalize the corresponding definitions in probability theory. Our\u000adefinitions apply not only to probability theory, but also to Dempster-Shafer's\u000abelief-function theory, Spohn's epistemic-belief theory, and Zadeh's\u000apossibility theory. In fact, they apply to any uncertainty calculi that fit in\u000athe framework of valuation-based systems.

VOne Decade of Universal Artificial Intelligence
p532

VThe first decade of this century has seen the nascency of the first\u000amathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of\u000aUniversal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to\u000amany theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of\u000apapers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete\u000amathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and\u000arigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing\u000aintelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the\u000aphilosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of\u000arational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.\u000aRecently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally\u000ainvestigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough\u000ahas resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique\u000athat UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain\u000aknowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of\u000ainteractive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to\u000aplay TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without\u000aeven providing the rules of the games.\u000a  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General\u000aIntelligence is not elusive.\u000a  This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to\u000agently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and\u000adiscusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence, some\u000asocial questions, and the past and future of UAI.

VGuess-And-Verify Heuristics for Reducing Uncertainties in Expert\u000a  Classification Systems

VAn expert classification system having statistical information about the\u000aprior probabilities of the different classes should be able to use this\u000aknowledge to reduce the amount of additional information that it must collect,\u000ae.g., through questions, in order to make a correct classification. This paper\u000aexamines how best to use such prior information and additional\u000ainformation-collection opportunities to reduce uncertainty about the class to\u000awhich a case belongs, thus minimizing the average cost or effort required to\u000acorrectly classify new cases.

VLocal Codes with Cooperative Repair in Distributed Storage System
p560
sg15
VRecently, the research on local repair codes is mainly confined to repair the\u000afailed nodes within each repair group. But if the extreme cases occur that the\u000aentire repair group has failed, the local code stored in the failed group need\u000ato be recovered as a whole. In this paper, local codes with cooperative repair,\u000ain which the local codes are constructed based on minimum storage regeneration\u000a(MSR) codes, is proposed to achieve repairing the failed groups. Specifically,\u000athe proposed local codes with cooperative repair construct a kind of mutual\u000ainterleaving structure among the parity symbols, that the parity symbols of\u000aeach local code, named as distributed local parity, can be generated by the\u000aparity symbols of the MSR codes in its two adjacent local codes. Taking\u000aadvantage of the structure given, the failed local groups can be repaired\u000acooperatively by their adjacent local groups with lower repair locality, and\u000ameanwhile the minimum distance of local codes with cooperative repair is\u000aderived. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that, compared\u000awith codes with local regeneration (such as MSR-local codes and MBR-local\u000acodes), the proposed local codes with cooperative repair have benefits in\u000abandwidth overhead and repair locality for the case of local groups failure.

We propose a rapid prototyping approach to network\u000aengineering. We describe criteria for identifying network modules and the use\u000aof "stubs" to represent not-yet-constructed modules. We propose an object\u000aoriented representation for belief networks which captures the semantics of the\u000aproblem in addition to conditional independencies and probabilities. Methods\u000afor evaluating complex belief network models are discussed. The ideas are\u000aillustrated with examples from a large belief network construction problem in\u000athe military intelligence domain.

In this view, which we call mechanism-based, causality is defined within\u000amodels and causal asymmetries arise when mechanisms are placed in the context\u000aof a system. We lay the link between structural equations models and BBNs\u000amodels and formulate the conditions under which the latter can be given causal\u000ainterpretation.

VArtificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical\u000a  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach
p625
sg7
VIn the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the\u000agrowing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that\u000aoften do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose\u000aoptimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a\u000ageneral purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence\u000a(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential\u000afunctions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare\u000apolicies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial\u000aintelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines\u000aMarkov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical\u000adata and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential\u000adecision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic\u000ainteractions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in\u000apartially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)\u000aby maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an\u000aonline agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real\u000apatient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily\u000aoutperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service\u000amodels of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a\u000a30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further\u000aenhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly\u000ahalf the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation\u000aframework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain\u000aenvironments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of\u000aresearch and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized\u000amedicine.

The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical\u000aframework for analyzing model management approaches. For a probability\u000aforecasting problem, a search process over small world models is analyzed as an\u000aapproximation to a larger-world model which the agent cannot explicitly\u000aenumerate or compute. Conditions are given under which the sequence of\u000asmall-world models converges to the larger-world probabilities.

Future progress of new computational devices capable of\u000adealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive\u000arobotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In\u000athis article we first present the current state of the art through\u000asystematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural\u000aframework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information\u000aprocessing, and given that there is no information without (physical)\u000arepresentation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is\u000aphysical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic\u000acomputation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic\u000anatural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes,\u000acontaining the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly\u000aintelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present\u000aarticle offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future\u000apaths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new\u000acomputational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using\u000adifferent mechanisms of intrinsic computation.

VThe Dissecting Power of Regular Languages
p679
sg436
VA recent study on structural properties of regular and context-free languages\u000ahas greatly promoted our basic understandings of the complex behaviors of those\u000alanguages. We continue the study to examine how regular languages behave when\u000athey need to cut numerous infinite languages. A particular interest rests on a\u000asituation in which a regular language needs to "dissect" a given infinite\u000alanguage into two subsets of infinite size. Every context-free language is\u000adissected by carefully chosen regular languages (or it is REG-dissectible). In\u000aa larger picture, we show that constantly-growing languages and semi-linear\u000alanguages are REG-dissectible. Under certain natural conditions, complements\u000aand finite intersections of semi-linear languages also become REG-dissectible.\u000aRestricted to bounded languages, the intersections of finitely many\u000acontext-free languages and, more surprisingly, the entire Boolean hierarchy\u000aover bounded context-free languages are REG-dissectible. As an immediate\u000aapplication of the REG-dissectibility, we show another structural property, in\u000awhich an appropriate bounded context-free language can "separate with infinite\u000amargins" two given nested infinite bounded context-free languages.

VThis paper examines the interdependence generated between two parent nodes\u000awith a common instantiated child node, such as two hypotheses sharing common\u000aevidence. The relation so generated has been termed "intercausal." It is shown\u000aby construction that inter-causal independence is possible for binary\u000adistributions at one state of evidence. For such "CICI" distributions, the two\u000ameasures of inter-causal effect, "multiplicative synergy" and "additive\u000asynergy" are equal. The well known "noisy-or" model is an example of such a\u000adistribution. This introduces novel semantics for the noisy-or, as a model of\u000athe degree of conflict among competing hypotheses of a common observation.

VThe Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial\u000a  Cosmogenesis
p704
sg7
VThis philosophical paper explores the relation between modern scientific\u000asimulations and the future of the universe. We argue that a simulation of an\u000aentire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us\u000ato tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a\u000asingle simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological\u000aevolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution\u000a(a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we\u000awould "replay the tape of the universe" with the same or different laws and\u000ainitial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world\u000amodelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire\u000auniverse, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that\u000awe may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a\u000asimulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new\u000auniverse. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative\u000aphilosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the\u000aheat death problem in cosmology. The reader is invited to consult Annex 1 for\u000aan overview of the logical structure of this paper. -- Keywords: far future,\u000afuture of science, ALife, simulation, realization, cosmology, heat death,\u000afine-tuning, physical eschatology, cosmological natural selection, cosmological\u000aartificial selection, artificial cosmogenesis, selfish biocosm hypothesis,\u000ameduso-anthropic principle, developmental singularity hypothesis, role of\u000aintelligent life.

VThe Optimality of Satisficing Solutions
p714
sg7
VThis paper addresses a prevailing assumption in single-agent heuristic search\u000atheory- that problem-solving algorithms should guarantee shortest-path\u000asolutions, which are typically called optimal. Optimality implies a metric for\u000ajudging solution quality, where the optimal solution is the solution with the\u000ahighest quality. When path-length is the metric, we will distinguish such\u000asolutions as p-optimal.

VThe origin of the numerals that we inherited from the arabo-Islamic\u000acivilization remained one enigma. The hypothesis of the Indian origin remained,\u000awith controversies, without serious rival. It was the dominant hypothesis since\u000amore of one century. Its partisans found to it and constructed a lot of\u000aarguments. The testimonies of the medieval authors have been interpreted to its\u000aadvantage. The opposite opinions have been dismissed and ignored. An amalgam\u000abetween the history of our modern numerals and the Indian mathematics history\u000ais made. Rational contradictions often passed under silence. A meticulous\u000aobservation of the numerals permits to affirm that our numerals are in fact\u000amore or less modified Arabic letters. The "Ghubari" shape of the numerals shows\u000athat the symbol of a numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose numerical\u000avalue is equal to this numeral. The numerals don't have a simple resemblance\u000awith some Arabic letters, but every number looks like the Arabic letter whose\u000anumerical value is equal to this numeral. The elements of the ''Abjadi''\u000acalculation gives us a theoretical support, independent of the letters and\u000anumerals, witch explains our observation. Besides a re-lecture of the\u000atestimonies of the medieval authors, particularly the testimony of Al-Biruni,\u000athat is probably at the origin of all others testimonies speaking of the Indian\u000aorigin of the numerals, is in agreement with the fact that our numerals are\u000aArabic letters. We have there a second way concerning the origin of our modern\u000anumerals that is only to its beginnings. The deepened researches are necessary\u000ato understand the history of our numerals better. A rigorous re-lecture of the\u000amedieval testimonies with a new mind imposes itself.

VQuantum Computing and Phase Transitions in Combinatorial Search
p762
sg7
VWe introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that\u000ais capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP\u000asearch problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of\u000aproblem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive\u000asearch choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions\u000athan the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical\u000aevaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same\u000aphase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously\u000astudied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are\u000aconcentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained\u000aproblems.

An important characteristic of several methodologies that reason with\u000achanges in belief or belief updates, is a property that we term modularity. We\u000acall updates that satisfy this property modular updates. Whereas probabilistic\u000ameasures of belief update - which satisfy the modularity property were first\u000adiscovered in the nineteenth century, knowledge and discussion of these\u000aquantities remains obscure in artificial intelligence research.

VWe study new classes of games, called zero-sum equivalent games and zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games, and prove decomposition theorems involving these\u000aclasses of games. We say that two games are "strategically equivalent" if, for\u000aevery player, the payoff differences between two strategies (holding other\u000aplayers' strategies fixed) are identical. A zero-sum equivalent game is a game\u000athat is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game; a zero-sum equivalent\u000apotential game is a zero-sum equivalent game that is strategically equivalent\u000ato a common interest game. We also call a game "normalized" if the sum of one\u000aplayer's payoffs, given the other players' strategies, is always zero. We show\u000athat any normal form game can be uniquely decomposed into either (i) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent game and a normalized common interest game, or (ii) a zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential game, a normalized zero-sum game, and a normalized common\u000ainterest game, each with distinctive equilibrium properties. For example, we\u000ashow that two-player zero-sum equivalent games with finite strategy sets\u000agenerically have a unique Nash equilibrium and that two-player zero-sum\u000aequivalent potential games with finite strategy sets generically have a\u000astrictly dominant Nash equilibrium.

In this paper, we consider\u000aa slightly more realistic model, by incorporating the notion of obstructed\u000avisibility (i.e., robots are not see through) for other robots. Under the new\u000amodel of visibility, a robot may not have the full view of its surroundings.\u000aMany of the existing algorithms demand that each robot should have the complete\u000aknowledge of the positions of other robots. Since, vision is the only mean of\u000atheir communication, it is required that the robots are in general position\u000a(i.e., no three robots are collinear). We consider asynchronous robots. They\u000aalso do not have common chirality (or any agreement on a global coordinate\u000asystem). In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for obtaining a\u000ageneral position for the robots in finite time from any arbitrary\u000aconfiguration. The algorithm also assures collision free motion for each robot.\u000aThis algorithm may also be used as a preprocessing module for many other\u000asubsequent tasks performed by the robots.

VWe studied 101 flux emergence events ranging from small ephemeral regions to\u000alarge emerging flux regions which were observed with Hinode Solar Optical\u000aTelescope filtergram. We investigated how the total magnetic flux of the\u000aemergence event controls the nature of emergence. To determine the modes of\u000aemergences, horizontal velocity fields of global motion of the magnetic patches\u000ain the flux emerging sites were measured by the local correlation tracking.\u000aBetween two main polarities of the large emerging flux regions with more than\u000aaround 2 \u005ctimes 10^19 Mx, there were the converging flows of anti-polarity\u000amagnetic patches. On the other hand, small ephemeral regions showed no\u000aconverging flow but simple diverging pattern. When we looked into the detailed\u000afeatures in the emerging sites, irrespective of the total flux and the spatial\u000asize, all the emergence events were observed to consist of single or multiple\u000aelementary emergence unit(s). The typical size of unitary emergence is 4 Mm and\u000aconsistent with the simulation results. From the statistical study of the flux\u000aemergence events, the maximum spatial distance between two main polarities, the\u000amagnetic flux growth rate and the mean separation speed were found to follow\u000athe power-law functions of the total magnetic flux with the indices of 0.27,\u000a0.57, and -0.16, respectively. From the discussion on the observed power-law\u000arelations, we got a physical view of solar flux emergence that emerging\u000amagnetic fields float and evolve balancing to the surrounding turbulent\u000aatmosphere. Key words: Sun: magnetic fields - Sun: emerging flux - Sun:\u000aphotosphere - Sun: chromosphere

VThe classical propositional assumption-based model is extended to incorporate\u000aprobabilities for the assumptions. Then it is placed into the framework of\u000aevidence theory. Several authors like Laskey, Lehner (1989) and Provan (1990)\u000aalready proposed a similar point of view, but the first paper is not as much\u000aconcerned with mathematical foundations, and Provan's paper develops into a\u000adifferent direction. Here we thoroughly develop and present the mathematical\u000afoundations of this theory, together with computational methods adapted from\u000aReiter, De Kleer (1987) and Inoue (1992). Finally, recently proposed techniques\u000afor computing degrees of support are presented.

VSexual reproductive behavior has a necessary social coordination component as\u000awilling and capable partners must both be in the right place at the right time.\u000aWhile there are many known social behavioral adaptations to support solutions\u000ato this problem, we explore the possibility and likelihood of solutions that\u000arely only on non-social mechanisms. We find three kinds of social organization\u000athat help solve this social coordination problem (herding, assortative mating,\u000aand natal philopatry) emerge in populations of simulated agents with no social\u000amechanisms available to support these organizations. We conclude that the\u000anon-social origins of these social organizations around sexual reproduction may\u000aprovide the environment for the development of social solutions to the same and\u000adifferent problems.

VDesign of Automatically Adaptable Web Wrappers
p913
sg7
VNowadays, the huge amount of information distributed through the Web\u000amotivates studying techniques to be adopted in order to extract relevant data\u000ain an efficient and reliable way. Both academia and enterprises developed\u000aseveral approaches of Web data extraction, for example using techniques of\u000aartificial intelligence or machine learning. Some commonly adopted procedures,\u000anamely wrappers, ensure a high degree of precision of information extracted\u000afrom Web pages, and, at the same time, have to prove robustness in order not to\u000acompromise quality and reliability of data themselves. In this paper we focus\u000aon some experimental aspects related to the robustness of the data extraction\u000aprocess and the possibility of automatically adapting wrappers. We discuss the\u000aimplementation of algorithms for finding similarities between two different\u000aversion of a Web page, in order to handle modifications, avoiding the failure\u000aof data extraction tasks and ensuring reliability of information extracted. Our\u000apurpose is to evaluate performances, advantages and draw-backs of our novel\u000asystem of automatic wrapper adaptation.

VIn this paper, we propose a new methodology based on the Negative Selection\u000aAlgorithm that belongs to the field of Computational Intelligence,\u000aspecifically, Artificial Immune Systems to identify takeover targets. Although\u000aconsiderable research based on customary statistical techniques and some\u000acontemporary Computational Intelligence techniques have been devoted to\u000aidentify takeover targets, most of the existing studies are based upon multiple\u000aprevious mergers and acquisitions. Contrary to previous research, the novelty\u000aof this proposal lies in its ability to suggest takeover targets for novice\u000afirms that are at the beginning of their merger and acquisition spree. We first\u000adiscuss the theoretical perspective and then provide a case study with details\u000afor practical implementation, both capitalizing from unique generalization\u000acapabilities of artificial immune systems algorithms.

VAutomated Termination Analysis for Logic Programs with Cut

sg62
VTermination is an important and well-studied property for logic programs.\u000aHowever, almost all approaches for automated termination analysis focus on\u000adefinite logic programs, whereas real-world Prolog programs typically use the\u000acut operator. We introduce a novel pre-processing method which automatically\u000atransforms Prolog programs into logic programs without cuts, where termination\u000aof the cut-free program implies termination of the original program. Hence\u000aafter this pre-processing, any technique for proving termination of definite\u000alogic programs can be applied. We implemented this pre-processing in our\u000atermination prover AProVE and evaluated it successfully with extensive\u000aexperiments.

These methods are used\u000awhen intelligence reports arrive which concerns different events which should\u000abe handled independently, when it is not known a priori to which event each\u000aintelligence report is related. We use clustering that runs as a back-end\u000aprocess to partition the intelligence into subsets representing the events, and\u000ain parallel, a fast classification that runs as a front-end process in order to\u000aput the newly arriving intelligence into its correct information fusion\u000aprocess.

VThis paper takes the first step towards the development of a control\u000aframework for underactuated flying humanoid robots. We assume that the robot is\u000apowered by four thrust forces placed at the robot end effectors, namely the\u000arobot hands and feet. Then, the control objective is defined as the asymptotic\u000astabilization of the robot centroidal momentum. This objective allows us to\u000atrack a desired trajectory for the robot center of mass and keep small errors\u000abetween a reference orientation and the robot base frame. Stability and\u000aconvergence of the robot momentum are shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov.\u000aSimulations carried out on a model of the humanoid robot iCub verify the\u000asoundness of the proposed approach.

VComputer-supported learning is an increasingly important form of study since\u000ait allows for independent learning and individualized instruction. In this\u000apaper, we discuss a novel approach to developing an intelligent tutoring system\u000afor teaching textbook-style mathematical proofs. We characterize the\u000aparticularities of the domain and discuss common ITS design models. Our\u000aapproach is motivated by phenomena found in a corpus of tutorial dialogs that\u000awere collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. We show how an intelligent tutor\u000afor textbook-style mathematical proofs can be built on top of an adapted\u000aassertion-level proof assistant by reusing representations and proof search\u000astrategies originally developed for automated and interactive theorem proving.\u000aThe resulting prototype was successfully evaluated on a corpus of tutorial\u000adialogs and yields good results.

VSimulations of Quantum Turing Machines by Quantum Multi-Stack Machines
p1111
sg651
VAs was well known, in classical computation, Turing machines, circuits,\u000amulti-stack machines, and multi-counter machines are equivalent, that is, they\u000acan simulate each other in polynomial time. In quantum computation, Yao [11]\u000afirst proved that for any quantum Turing machines $M$, there exists quantum\u000aBoolean circuit $(n,t)$-simulating $M$, where $n$ denotes the length of input\u000astrings, and $t$ is the number of move steps before machine stopping. However,\u000athe simulations of quantum Turing machines by quantum multi-stack machines and\u000aquantum multi-counter machines have not been considered, and quantum\u000amulti-stack machines have not been established, either. Though quantum counter\u000amachines were dealt with by Kravtsev [6] and Yamasaki {\u005cit et al.} [10], in\u000awhich the machines count with $0,\u005cpm 1$ only, we sense that it is difficult to\u000asimulate quantum Turing machines in terms of this fashion of quantum computing\u000adevices, and we therefore prove that the quantum multi-counter machines allowed\u000ato count with $0,\u005cpm 1,\u005cpm 2,...,\u005cpm n$ for some $n>1$ can efficiently simulate\u000aquantum Turing machines.\u000a  Therefore, our mail goals are to establish quantum multi-stack machines and\u000aquantum multi-counter machines with counts $0,\u005cpm 1,\u005cpm 2,...,\u005cpm n$ and $n>1$,\u000aand particularly to simulate quantum Turing machines by these quantum computing\u000adevices.

VAccess control is an issue of paramount importance in cyber-physical systems\u000a(CPS). In this paper, an access control scheme, namely FEAC, is presented for\u000aCPS. FEAC can not only provide the ability to control access to data in normal\u000asituations, but also adaptively assign emergency-role and permissions to\u000aspecific subjects and inform subjects without explicit access requests to\u000ahandle emergency situations in a proactive manner. In FEAC, emergency-group and\u000aemergency-dependency are introduced. Emergencies are processed in sequence\u000awithin the group and in parallel among groups. A priority and dependency model\u000acalled PD-AGM is used to select optimal response-action execution path aiming\u000ato eliminate all emergencies that occurred within the system. Fault-tolerant\u000aaccess control polices are used to address failure in emergency management. A\u000acase study of the hospital medical care application shows the effectiveness of\u000aFEAC.

p1139

VThe intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part\u000aII discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two\u000asimultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.\u000a  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is\u000aa difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an\u000aintelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises\u000aa sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the\u000alocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was\u000atested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\u000alocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\u000adimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\u000aaccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\u000athe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\u000aintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\u000aavoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\u000aframe structures by the acoustic emission method.

Specifically, I suggest a\u000agraphical representation of argument databases, called argument networks, which\u000aresemble Bayesian networks. I also suggest an algorithm for reasoning with\u000aargument networks, which resembles a basic algorithm for reasoning with\u000aBayesian networks. Finally, I show that argument networks have several\u000aapplications: Nonmonotonic reasoning, truth maintenance, and diagnosis.

VMESA: Maximum Entropy by Simulated Annealing

VProbabilistic reasoning systems combine different probabilistic rules and\u000aprobabilistic facts to arrive at the desired probability values of\u000aconsequences. In this paper we describe the MESA-algorithm (Maximum Entropy by\u000aSimulated Annealing) that derives a joint distribution of variables or\u000apropositions. It takes into account the reliability of probability values and\u000acan resolve conflicts between contradictory statements. The joint distribution\u000ais represented in terms of marginal distributions and therefore allows to\u000aprocess large inference networks and to determine desired probability values\u000awith high precision. The procedure derives a maximum entropy distribution\u000asubject to the given constraints. It can be applied to inference networks of\u000aarbitrary topology and may be extended into a number of directions.

Like many other real-world\u000aapplications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomous\u000adecision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this work\u000arepresents the first successful industrial application of embedded\u000adomain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures and\u000amulti-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combines\u000atechniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggest\u000athat this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more\u000aintelligent systems operate in continual, on-line settings. Our system has been\u000aused to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product\u000aarchitecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-art\u000aoff-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds\u000abetter plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planning\u000abased on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, and\u000amultiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiring\u000ahand-coded control knowledge.

We discuss the humanoid question and how\u000athe question of self-consciousness (and by association mind/thought/language)\u000awould affect humanoids too.

VThe problem of Natural Language Query Formalization (NLQF) is to translate a\u000agiven user query in natural language (NL) into a formal language so that the\u000asemantic interpretation has equivalence with the NL interpretation.\u000aFormalization of NL queries enables logic based reasoning during information\u000aretrieval, database query, question-answering, etc. Formalization also helps in\u000aWeb query normalization and indexing, query intent analysis, etc. In this paper\u000awe are proposing a Description Logics based formal methodology for wh-query\u000aintent (also called desire) identification and corresponding formal\u000atranslation. We evaluated the scalability of our proposed formalism using\u000aMicrosoft Encarta 98 query dataset and OWL-S TC v.4.0 dataset.

VThe SP Theory of Intelligence as a Foundation for the Development of a\u000a  General, Human-Level Thinking Machine
p1255
sg7
VThis paper summarises how the "SP theory of intelligence" and its realisation\u000ain the "SP computer model" simplifies and integrates concepts across artificial\u000aintelligence and related areas, and thus provides a promising foundation for\u000athe development of a general, human-level thinking machine, in accordance with\u000athe main goal of research in artificial general intelligence.\u000a  The key to this simplification and integration is the powerful concept of\u000a"multiple alignment", borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. This concept\u000ahas the potential to be the "double helix" of intelligence, with as much\u000asignificance for human-level intelligence as has DNA for biological sciences.\u000a  Strengths of the SP system include: versatility in the representation of\u000adiverse kinds of knowledge; versatility in aspects of intelligence (including:\u000astrengths in unsupervised learning; the processing of natural language; pattern\u000arecognition at multiple levels of abstraction that is robust in the face of\u000aerrors in data; several kinds of reasoning (including: one-step `deductive'\u000areasoning; chains of reasoning; abductive reasoning; reasoning with\u000aprobabilistic networks and trees; reasoning with 'rules'; nonmonotonic\u000areasoning and reasoning with default values; Bayesian reasoning with\u000a'explaining away'; and more); planning; problem solving; and more); seamless\u000aintegration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence\u000ain any combination; and potential for application in several areas (including:\u000ahelping to solve nine problems with big data; helping to develop human-level\u000aintelligence in autonomous robots; serving as a database with intelligence and\u000awith versatility in the representation and integration of several forms of\u000aknowledge; serving as a vehicle for medical knowledge and as an aid to medical\u000adiagnosis; and several more).

VVariable elimination is a general technique for constraint processing. It is\u000aoften discarded because of its high space complexity. However, it can be\u000aextremely useful when combined with other techniques. In this paper we study\u000athe applicability of variable elimination to the challenging problem of finding\u000astill-lifes. We illustrate several alternatives: variable elimination as a\u000astand-alone algorithm, interleaved with search, and as a source of good quality\u000alower bounds. We show that these techniques are the best known option both\u000atheoretically and empirically. In our experiments we have been able to solve\u000athe n=20 instance, which is far beyond reach with alternative approaches.

VMultiplex networks describe a large variety of complex systems, whose\u000aelements (nodes) can be connected by different types of interactions forming\u000adifferent layers (networks) of the multiplex. Multiplex networks include social\u000anetworks, transportation networks or biological networks in the cell or in the\u000abrain. Extracting relevant information from these networks is of crucial\u000aimportance for solving challenging inference problems and for characterizing\u000athe multiplex networks microscopic and mesoscopic structure. Here we propose an\u000ainformation theory method to extract the network between the layers of\u000amultiplex datasets, forming a "network of networks". We build an indicator\u000afunction, based on the entropy of network ensembles, to characterize the\u000amesoscopic similarities between the layers of a multiplex network and we use\u000aclustering techniques to characterize the communities present in this network\u000aof networks.

VStable models and an alternative logic programming paradigm
p1334
sg62
VIn this paper we reexamine the place and role of stable model semantics in\u000alogic programming and contrast it with a least Herbrand model approach to Horn\u000aprograms. We demonstrate that inherent features of stable model semantics\u000anaturally lead to a logic programming system that offers an interesting\u000aalternative to more traditional logic programming styles of Horn logic\u000aprogramming, stratified logic programming and logic programming with\u000awell-founded semantics. The proposed approach is based on the interpretation of\u000aprogram clauses as constraints. In this setting programs do not describe a\u000asingle intended model, but a family of stable models. These stable models\u000aencode solutions to the constraint satisfaction problem described by the\u000aprogram. Our approach imposes restrictions on the syntax of logic programs. In\u000aparticular, function symbols are eliminated from the language. We argue that\u000athe resulting logic programming system is well-attuned to problems in the class\u000aNP, has a well-defined domain of applications, and an emerging methodology of\u000aprogramming. We point out that what makes the whole approach viable is recent\u000aprogress in implementations of algorithms to compute stable models of\u000apropositional logic programs.

VSpecialized intelligent systems can be found everywhere: finger print,\u000ahandwriting, speech, and face recognition, spam filtering, chess and other game\u000aprograms, robots, et al. This decade the first presumably complete mathematical\u000atheory of artificial intelligence based on universal\u000ainduction-prediction-decision-action has been proposed. This\u000ainformation-theoretic approach solidifies the foundations of inductive\u000ainference and artificial intelligence. Getting the foundations right usually\u000amarks a significant progress and maturing of a field. The theory provides a\u000agold standard and guidance for researchers working on intelligent algorithms.\u000aThe roots of universal induction have been laid exactly half-a-century ago and\u000athe roots of universal intelligence exactly one decade ago. So it is timely to\u000atake stock of what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Since there\u000aare already good recent surveys, I describe the state-of-the-art only in\u000apassing and refer the reader to the literature. This article concentrates on\u000athe open problems in universal induction and its extension to universal\u000aintelligence.

VMapping constrained optimization problems to quantum annealing with\u000a  application to fault diagnosis
p1399
sg382
VCurrent quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations\u000asuch as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and\u000acontrol error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint\u000asatisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In\u000aparticular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a\u000ahardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two\u000anew decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly\u000ainto hardware.\u000a  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising\u000amodels are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in\u000adifferent constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In\u000acontrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising\u000amodel for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to\u000agenerate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of\u000aCSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local\u000amapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.\u000a  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based\u000afault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is\u000atypically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N\u000ausing 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a\u000aleading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms\u000ato find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than\u000acan be solved directly on current hardware.

VWhy Artificial Intelligence Needs a Task Theory --- And What It Might\u000a  Look Like
p1409
sg7
VThe concept of "task" is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI): Tasks\u000aare used for training and evaluating AI systems, which are built in order to\u000aperform and automatize tasks we deem useful. In other fields of engineering\u000atheoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical\u000amanipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance;\u000athis allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the\u000aeffects of wind speed on an airplane's performance and stability. No framework\u000aexists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance\u000aresults on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering)\u000acannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more\u000aacute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must\u000ahandle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task\u000atheory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their\u000aspecifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks,\u000aenvironments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of\u000ameasuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest\u000aimprovements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of\u000amachine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the\u000aargument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like\u000afor physical tasks.

VLandau Theory of Adaptive Integration in Computational Intelligence
p1414
sg7
VComputational Intelligence (CI) is a sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence\u000aparadigm focusing on the study of adaptive mechanisms to enable or facilitate\u000aintelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. There are several\u000aparadigms of CI [like artificial neural networks, evolutionary computations,\u000aswarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fuzzy systems and many others],\u000aeach of these has its origins in biological systems [biological neural systems,\u000anatural Darwinian evolution, social behavior, immune system, interactions of\u000aorganisms with their environment]. Most of those paradigms evolved into\u000aseparate machine learning (ML) techniques, where probabilistic methods are used\u000acomplementary with CI techniques in order to effectively combine elements of\u000alearning, adaptation, evolution and Fuzzy logic to create heuristic algorithms\u000athat are, in some sense, intelligent. The current trend is to develop consensus\u000atechniques, since no single machine learning algorithms is superior to others\u000ain all possible situations. In order to overcome this problem several\u000ameta-approaches were proposed in ML focusing on the integration of results from\u000adifferent methods into single prediction. We discuss here the Landau theory for\u000athe nonlinear equation that can describe the adaptive integration of\u000ainformation acquired from an ensemble of independent learning agents. The\u000ainfluence of each individual agent on other learners is described similarly to\u000athe social impact theory. The final decision outcome for the consensus system\u000ais calculated using majority rule in the stationary limit, yet the minority\u000asolutions can survive inside the majority population as the complex\u000aintermittent clusters of opposite opinion.

VLocation management refers to the problem of updating and searching the\u000acurrent location of mobile nodes in a wireless network. To make it efficient,\u000athe sum of update costs of location database must be minimized. Previous work\u000arelying on fixed location databases is unable to fully exploit the knowledge of\u000auser mobility patterns in the system so as to achieve this minimization. The\u000astudy presents an intelligent location management approach which has interacts\u000abetween intelligent information system and knowledge-base technologies, so we\u000acan dynamically change the user patterns and reduce the transition between the\u000aVLR and HLR.

VThere exists an injective, information-preserving function that maps a\u000asemantic network (i.e a directed labeled network) to a directed network (i.e. a\u000adirected unlabeled network). The edge label in the semantic network is\u000arepresented as a topological feature of the directed network. Also, there\u000aexists an injective function that maps a directed network to an undirected\u000anetwork (i.e. an undirected unlabeled network). The edge directionality in the\u000adirected network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected\u000anetwork. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that\u000amaps a semantic network to an undirected network. Thus, aside from space\u000aconstraints, the semantic network construct does not have any modeling\u000afunctionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network\u000arepresentation. Two proofs of this idea will be presented. The first is a proof\u000aof the aforementioned function composition concept. The second is a simpler\u000aproof involving an undirected binary encoding of a semantic network.

VA Nondeterministic Model for Abstract Geometrical Computation

sg651
VA signal machine is an abstract geometrical model for computation, proposed\u000aas an extension to the one-dimensional cellular automata, in which discrete\u000atime and space of cellular automata is replaced with continuous time and space\u000ain signal machine. A signal machine is defined as a set of meta-signals and a\u000aset of rules. A signal machine starts from an initial configuration which is a\u000aset of moving signals. Signals are moving in space freely until a collision.\u000aRules of signal machine specify what happens after a collision, or in other\u000awords, specify out-coming signals for each set of colliding signals. Originally\u000asignal machine is defined by its rule as a deterministic machine. In this\u000apaper, we introduce the concept of non-deterministic signal machine, which may\u000acontain more than one defined rule for each set of colliding signals. We show\u000athat for a specific class of nondeterministic signal machines, called\u000ak-restricted nondeterministic signal machine, there is a deterministic signal\u000amachine computing the same result as the nondeterministic one, on any given\u000ainitial configuration. k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine is a\u000anondeterministic signal machine which accepts an input iff produces a special\u000aaccepting signal, which have at most two nondeterministic rule for each\u000acollision, and at most k collisions before any acceptance.

VHete-CF: Social-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation using\u000a  Heterogeneous Relations
p1467
sg85
VCollaborative filtering algorithms haven been widely used in recommender\u000asystems. However, they often suffer from the data sparsity and cold start\u000aproblems. With the increasing popularity of social media, these problems may be\u000asolved by using social-based recommendation. Social-based recommendation, as an\u000aemerging research area, uses social information to help mitigate the data\u000asparsity and cold start problems, and it has been demonstrated that the\u000asocial-based recommendation algorithms can efficiently improve the\u000arecommendation performance. However, few of the existing algorithms have\u000aconsidered using multiple types of relations within one social network. In this\u000apaper, we investigate the social-based recommendation algorithms on\u000aheterogeneous social networks and proposed Hete-CF, a Social Collaborative\u000aFiltering algorithm using heterogeneous relations. Distinct from the exiting\u000amethods, Hete-CF can effectively utilize multiple types of relations in a\u000aheterogeneous social network. In addition, Hete-CF is a general approach and\u000acan be used in arbitrary social networks, including event based social\u000anetworks, location based social networks, and any other types of heterogeneous\u000ainformation networks associated with social information. The experimental\u000aresults on two real-world data sets, DBLP (a typical heterogeneous information\u000anetwork) and Meetup (a typical event based social network) show the\u000aeffectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

Unlike Dependency Graphs, Causal Models are models of\u000ahierarchical and/or parallel processes, rather than models of distributions\u000a(partially) known to a model builder through some sort of gestalt. As such,\u000aCausal Models are more modular, easier to build, more intuitive, and easier to\u000aunderstand than Dependency Graph Models. Causal Models are formally defined and\u000aDependency Graph Models are shown to be a special case of them. Algorithms\u000asupporting inference are presented. Parsimonious methods for eliciting\u000adependent probabilities are presented.

VA Model for Web-Intelligence Index to Evaluate the Web Intelligence\u000a  Capacity of Government Web Sites of Sri Lanka
p1497

VWeb intelligence can be considered as a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It\u000auses existing data in web to produce new data, knowledge and wisdom to support\u000adecision making and new predictions for web users. Artificial Intelligence is\u000aever changing and evolving field of computer science and it is extensively used\u000ain wide array of web based business applications. Although it is used\u000asubstantially in web based systems in developed countries, it is not examined\u000awhether it is being substantially used in Sri Lanka. Every Sri Lankan citizen\u000adepends on Public Service more or less throughout his/ her life time and at\u000aleast more than 3 times: at birth, marriage and death. So providing most of\u000athese services to its citizen, Sri Lankan Government uses more or less of its\u000acountry web portal. This paper presents a model to evaluate web intelligence\u000acapability based on weight to key functionalities with respect to web\u000aintelligence. The government websites were checked by the proposed criteria to\u000ashow the potential of using web intelligent technology to provide website based\u000aservices. The result indicates that the use of web intelligence techniques\u000aopenly and publicly to provide web based services through government web portal\u000ato its citizens is not satisfactory. It also indicates that lack of using the\u000atechnologies pertaining to web intelligence in the public service web hinders\u000athe most of the advantages that citizen and government can gain from such\u000atechnological involvement.

Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2\u000atheory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts\u000aneeded to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible\u000acomputable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\u005cPhi$ defined on a\u000aset $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \u005ctau_\u005cPhi,\u000a\u005cbeta_\u005cPhi, \u005cnu_\u005cPhi)$, where $\u005ctau_\u005cPhi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by\u000a$\u005cPhi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes\u000athe computable structure determined by $\u005cPhi$. The concept of computable\u000asubmanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold\u000awhich satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be\u000aembedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\u005cmathbb{R}^{q}$,\u000awith a computable embedding, where $\u005cmathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual\u000atopology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.

After explaining this\u000astance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of\u000aartifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of\u000aco-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly\u000aintegrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine\u000athe ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction\u000aparadigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated\u000acan therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from\u000athe environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the\u000arelevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such\u000areflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in\u000aorder to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial\u000aintelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an\u000aenactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,\u000athereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of\u000amorphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of\u000aminimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the\u000aproblem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.

VIn this paper, the idea of a new artificial intelligence based optimization\u000aalgorithm, which is inspired from the nature of vortex, has been provided\u000abriefly. As also a bio-inspired computation algorithm, the idea is generally\u000afocused on a typical vortex flow / behavior in nature and inspires from some\u000adynamics that are occurred in the sense of vortex nature. Briefly, the\u000aalgorithm is also a swarm-oriented evolutional problem solution approach;\u000abecause it includes many methods related to elimination of weak swarm members\u000aand trying to improve the solution process by supporting the solution space via\u000anew swarm members. In order have better idea about success of the algorithm; it\u000ahas been tested via some benchmark functions. At this point, the obtained\u000aresults show that the algorithm can be an alternative to the literature in\u000aterms of single-objective optimization solution ways. Vortex Optimization\u000aAlgorithm (VOA) is the name suggestion by the authors; for this new idea of\u000aintelligent optimization approach.

VA Study on Artificial Intelligence IQ and Standard Intelligent Model

VCurrently, potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI) to human have\u000atriggered a large controversy in society, behind which, the nature of the issue\u000ais whether the artificial intelligence (AI) system can be evaluated\u000aquantitatively. This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI\u000adevelopment level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the\u000ahuman intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason\u000afor which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and\u000athe beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system\u000amodel is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings\u000alike human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract\u000amathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine\u000amathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the\u000aLiufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial\u000aintelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the\u000aevaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human\u000asubjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of\u000athe absolute IQ and deviation IQ ranking for artificial intelligence IQ 2014.

VData Cleaning is a long standing problem, which is growing in importance with\u000athe mass of uncurated web data. State of the art approaches for handling\u000ainconsistent data are systems that learn and use conditional functional\u000adependencies (CFDs) to rectify data. These methods learn data\u000apatterns--CFDs--from a clean sample of the data and use them to rectify the\u000adirty/inconsistent data. While getting a clean training sample is feasible in\u000aenterprise data scenarios, it is infeasible in web databases where there is no\u000aseparate curated data. CFD based methods are unfortunately particularly\u000asensitive to noise; we will empirically demonstrate that the number of CFDs\u000alearned falls quite drastically with even a small amount of noise. In order to\u000aovercome this limitation, we propose a fully probabilistic framework for\u000acleaning data. Our approach involves learning both the generative and error\u000a(corruption) models of the data and using them to clean the data. For\u000agenerative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data. For error models, we\u000aconsider a maximum entropy framework for combing multiple error processes. The\u000agenerative and error models are learned directly from the noisy data. We\u000apresent the details of the framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in\u000arectifying web data.

The variation principle, satisfying the EF-IPF\u000aequivalence along shortest path-trajectory, leads to information dual\u000acomplementary maxmin-minimax law, which creates mechanism of arising\u000ainformation regularities from stochastic process(Lerner 2012).

We analyze the interactive information\u000acontributions, information quality, inner time scale, information geometry of\u000athe cooperative structures, evaluate curvature of these geometrical forms and\u000atheir cooperative information complexities. The law information mechanisms\u000aoperate in information observer. The observer, acting according the law,\u000aselects random information, converts it in information dynamics, builds the IN\u000acooperatives, which generate the genetic code.

VA Theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence based on Algorithmic\u000a  Complexity
p1657
sg7
VDecision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in uncertain\u000aworlds if the true environmental prior probability distribution is known.\u000aSolomonoff's theory of universal induction formally solves the problem of\u000asequence prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both ideas and\u000aget a parameterless theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give strong\u000aarguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent\u000apossible. We outline for a number of problem classes, including sequence\u000aprediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and\u000asupervised learning, how the AIXI model can formally solve them. The major\u000adrawback of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this\u000aproblem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXI-tl, which is still effectively\u000amore intelligent than any other time t and space l bounded agent. The\u000acomputation time of AIXI-tl is of the order tx2^l. Other discussed topics are\u000aformal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and\u000arelations of the AIXI theory to other AI approaches.

VMeasuring Intelligence through Games
p1662
sg7
VArtificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to research aimed at tackling\u000athe full problem of artificial intelligence, that is, create truly intelligent\u000aagents. This sets it apart from most AI research which aims at solving\u000arelatively narrow domains, such as character recognition, motion planning, or\u000aincreasing player satisfaction in games. But how do we know when an agent is\u000atruly intelligent? A common point of reference in the AGI community is Legg and\u000aHutter's formal definition of universal intelligence, which has the appeal of\u000asimplicity and generality but is unfortunately incomputable. Games of various\u000akinds are commonly used as benchmarks for "narrow" AI research, as they are\u000aconsidered to have many important properties. We argue that many of these\u000aproperties carry over to the testing of general intelligence as well. We then\u000asketch how such testing could practically be carried out. The central part of\u000athis sketch is an extension of universal intelligence to deal with finite time,\u000aand the use of sampling of the space of games expressed in a suitably biased\u000agame description language.

VTree structures have been shown to provide an efficient framework for\u000apropagating beliefs [Pearl,1986]. This paper studies the problem of finding an\u000aoptimal approximating tree. The star decomposition scheme for sets of three\u000abinary variables [Lazarsfeld,1966; Pearl,1986] is shown to enhance the class of\u000aprobability distributions that can support tree structures; such structures are\u000acalled tree-decomposable structures. The logarithm scoring rule is found to be\u000aan appropriate optimality criterion to evaluate different tree-decomposable\u000astructures. Characteristics of such structures closest to the actual belief\u000anetwork are identified using the logarithm rule, and greedy and exact\u000atechniques are developed to find the optimal approximation.

This\u000amathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional\u000amathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the\u000aorthodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic\u000atool, or perhaps just "a simple curiosity." However, the IDM dis-crete\u000aapproaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.

VNon-Evolutionary Superintelligences Do Nothing, Eventually
p1737
sg7
VThere is overwhelming evidence that human intelligence is a product of\u000aDarwinian evolution. Investigating the consequences of self-modification, and\u000amore precisely, the consequences of utility function self-modification, leads\u000ato the stronger claim that not only human, but any form of intelligence is\u000aultimately only possible within evolutionary processes. Human-designed\u000aartificial intelligences can only remain stable until they discover how to\u000amanipulate their own utility function. By definition, a human designer cannot\u000aprevent a superhuman intelligence from modifying itself, even if protection\u000amechanisms against this action are put in place. Without evolutionary pressure,\u000asufficiently advanced artificial intelligences become inert by simplifying\u000atheir own utility function. Within evolutionary processes, the implicit utility\u000afunction is always reducible to persistence, and the control of superhuman\u000aintelligences embedded in evolutionary processes is not possible. Mechanisms\u000aagainst utility function self-modification are ultimately futile. Instead,\u000ascientific effort toward the mitigation of existential risks from the\u000adevelopment of superintelligences should be in two directions: understanding\u000aconsciousness, and the complex dynamics of evolutionary systems.

VUniversal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence
p1752
sg7
VA fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows\u000awhat intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider\u000aartificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper\u000awe approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known\u000ainformal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and\u000aextract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to\u000aproduce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe\u000athat this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the\u000abroadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related\u000ato the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many\u000aother tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for\u000amachines.

In order to change this we will introduce\u000asome parameters to which AI will depend. One of this parameters will be the\u000alevel of intelligence and we will define one AI to each level of intelligence.\u000aWe assume that for some level of intelligence the respective AI will be more\u000aintelligent than a human being. Nevertheless, we cannot say which is this level\u000abecause we cannot calculate its exact value.

VThrough the pagination of an Arabian Algerian manuscript of the beginning of\u000athe 19th century, we rediscover the original shape, the "Ghubari" shape, of the\u000anumerals. Contrary to some assumptions, particularly those which claim that\u000athey are derived from Indian characters, this "Ghubari" shape, whose use has\u000acompletely disappeared, shows that the ten modern numerals derive from ten\u000aArabic letters. The symbol of a "Ghubari" numeral corresponds to the Arabic\u000aletter whose "Abjadi" numerical value is equal to this numeral. The assumption\u000aof the Indian origin of the numerals is denied by the shape of the numerals and\u000aby the right left sociological logic of the representation of the numerals and\u000athe algorithms of the basic operations. The numerals are born in Maghreb or in\u000aSpain. In Europe, the "Ghubari" numerals became the modern numerals: 0, 1, 2,\u000a3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and in the Middle East, borrowing two Hebrew letters, they\u000agave the "Mashriki" numerals: &#1776; &#1777; &#1778; &#1779; &#1641; &#1640;\u000a&#1639; &#1638; &#1637; &#1636; .

VEulerian Field-Theoretic Closure Formalisms for Fluid Turbulence
p1807
sg162
VThe formalisms of Wyld [2] and Martin, Siggia, and Rose (MSR) [3] address the\u000aclosure problem of a statistical treatment of homogeneous isotropic turbulence\u000a(HIT) based on techniques primarily developed for quantum field theory. In the\u000aWyld formalism, there is a well-known double-counting problem, for which an\u000a{\u005cit ad hoc} solution was suggested by Lee [44]. We show how to implement this\u000acorrection in a more natural way from the basic equations of the formalism.\u000aThis leads to what we call the "Improved Wyld-Lee Renormalized Perturbation\u000aTheory". MSR had noted that their formalism had more vertex functions than\u000aWyld's formalism and based on this felt Wyld's formalism was incorrect. However\u000aa careful comparison of both formalisms here shows that the Wyld formalism\u000afollows a different procedure to that of the MSR formalism and so the treatment\u000aof vertex corrections appears in different ways in the two formalisms. Taking\u000athat into account, along with clarifications made to both formalisms, we find\u000athat they are equivalent and we demonstrate this up to fourth order.

VA World of Views: A World of Interacting Post-human Intelligences

VWhat would a human hundreds or thousands times more intelligent than the\u000abrightest human ever born be like? We must admit we can hardly guess. A human\u000abeing of such intelligence will be so radically different from us that it can\u000ahardly, if at all, be recognized as human. If we had to go back along the\u000aevolutionary tree to identify a creature 1000 times less intelligent than the\u000aaverage contemporary human, we will have to go really far back. Would it be a\u000akind of a lizard? An insect perhaps? Considering this, how can we possibly\u000aaspire to have a grasp of something a thousand times more intelligent than us?\u000aWhen it comes to intelligence, even the very attempt to quantify it is highly\u000amisleading. Now if we attend to a seemingly adjacent question, what would a\u000amachine with such capacity for intelligence be like? Just coming up with an\u000aapproximate metaphor requires a huge stretch of the imagination, meaning that\u000aalmost anything goes... What would a society of such super intelligent agents,\u000abe they human, machines or an amalgam of both, be like? Well, here we are\u000atransported into the realm of pure speculation. Technological Singularity is\u000areferred to as the event of artificial intelligence surpassing the intelligence\u000aof humans and shortly after augmenting itself far beyond that. It is no wonder\u000athat the mathematical concept of singularity has become the symbol of an event\u000aso disruptive and so far reaching that it is impossible to conceptually or even\u000ametaphorically grasp, much less to predict.

VDesigning a Safe Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agent based on Human\u000a  Self-Regulation
p1827
sg7
VThere is a growing focus on how to design safe artificial intelligent (AI)\u000aagents. As systems become more complex, poorly specified goals or control\u000amechanisms may cause AI agents to engage in unwanted and harmful outcomes. Thus\u000ait is necessary to design AI agents that follow initial programming intentions\u000aas the program grows in complexity. How to specify these initial intentions has\u000aalso been an obstacle to designing safe AI agents. Finally, there is a need for\u000athe AI agent to have redundant safety mechanisms to ensure that any programming\u000aerrors do not cascade into major problems. Humans are autonomous intelligent\u000aagents that have avoided these problems and the present manuscript argues that\u000aby understanding human self-regulation and goal setting, we may be better able\u000ato design safe AI agents. Some general principles of human self-regulation are\u000aoutlined and specific guidance for AI design is given.

VDeath and Suicide in Universal Artificial Intelligence
p1837
sg7
VReinforcement learning (RL) is a general paradigm for studying intelligent\u000abehaviour, with applications ranging from artificial intelligence to psychology\u000aand economics. AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn any\u000acomputable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is that it is defined\u000ausing a mixture over semimeasures that need not sum to 1, rather than over\u000aproper probability measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a\u000asemimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's estimate of the\u000aprobability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent\u000aagents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour.\u000aNotable discoveries include that agent behaviour can change radically under\u000apositive linear transformations of the reward signal (from suicidal to\u000adogmatically self-preserving), and that the agent's posterior belief that it\u000awill survive increases over time.

VOpen Ended Intelligence: The individuation of Intelligent Agents
p1862
sg7
VArtificial General Intelligence is a field of research aiming to distill the\u000aprinciples of intelligence that operate independently of a specific problem\u000adomain or a predefined context and utilize these principles in order to\u000asynthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is\u000acapable of and eventually go beyond that. While "narrow" artificial\u000aintelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech\u000arecognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion,\u000aetc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding\u000ageneral intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical\u000aapproach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief\u000aintroduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number\u000aof serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the\u000aconcept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence\u000aperceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a\u000apriori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative\u000aprocess of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We\u000acall this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed\u000aas an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application\u000acan be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three\u000afacets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making\u000aand the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how\u000aopen-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,\u000aself-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is\u000ascalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination\u000aand intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number\u000aof questions for future research.

VVarious properties of relative entropy have led to its widespread use in\u000ainformation theory. These properties suggest that relative entropy has a role\u000ato play in systems that attempt to perform inference in terms of probability\u000adistributions. In this paper, I will review some basic properties of relative\u000aentropy as well as its role in probabilistic inference. I will also mention\u000abriefly a few existing and potential applications of relative entropy to\u000aso-called artificial intelligence (AI).

VPDDL2.1 - The Art of the Possible? Commentary on Fox and Long
p1882
sg7
VPDDL2.1 was designed to push the envelope of what planning algorithms can do,\u000aand it has succeeded. It adds two important features: durative actions,which\u000atake time (and may have continuous effects); and objective functions for\u000ameasuring the quality of plans. The concept of durative actions is flawed; and\u000athe treatment of their semantics reveals too strong an attachment to the way\u000amany contemporary planners work. Future PDDL innovators should focus on\u000aproducing a clean semantics for additions to the language, and let planner\u000aimplementers worry about coupling their algorithms to problems expressed in the\u000alatest version of the language.

VAn architecture for the evaluation of intelligent systems
p1912
sg7
VOne of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of\u000aagents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This\u000ameans that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were\u000acreated for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer\u000ato the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide\u000awhether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its\u000aintelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.\u000aThe purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the\u000aexecution of several environments, including those which are generated\u000arandomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once\u000athe interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter\u000awill measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and\u000arewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a\u000aresult we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible\u000aenvironment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to\u000adetermine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,\u000athe interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really\u000auseful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated\u000aenvironment will serve that purpose.

VWith the increasing technical sophistication of both information consumers\u000aand providers, there is increasing demand for more meaningful experiences of\u000adigital information. We present a framework that separates digital object\u000aexperience, or rendering, from digital object storage and manipulation, so the\u000arendering can be tailored to particular communities of users. Our framework\u000aalso accommodates extensible digital object behaviors and interoperability. The\u000atwo key components of our approach are 1) exposing structural metadata\u000aassociated with digital objects -- metadata about the labeled access points\u000awithin a digital object and 2) information intermediaries called context\u000abrokers that match structural characteristics of digital objects with\u000amechanisms that produce behaviors. These context brokers allow for localized\u000arendering of digital information stored externally.

VLeveraging Social Foci for Information Seeking in Social Media
p1922

VThe rise of social media provides a great opportunity for people to reach out\u000ato their social connections to satisfy their information needs. However,\u000ageneric social media platforms are not explicitly designed to assist\u000ainformation seeking of users. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to\u000aidentify the social connections of a user able to satisfy his information\u000aneeds. The information need of a social media user is subjective and personal,\u000aand we investigate the utility of his social context to identify people able to\u000asatisfy it. We present questions users post on Twitter as instances of\u000ainformation seeking activities in social media. We infer soft community\u000amemberships of the asker and his social connections by integrating network and\u000acontent information. Drawing concepts from the social foci theory, we identify\u000aanswerers who share communities with the asker w.r.t. the question. Our\u000aexperiments demonstrate that the framework is effective in identifying\u000aanswerers to social media questions.

VA Novel Approach to Multimedia Ontology Engineering for Automated\u000a  Reasoning over Audiovisual LOD Datasets
p1927
sg1306
VMultimedia reasoning, which is suitable for, among others, multimedia content\u000aanalysis and high-level video scene interpretation, relies on the formal and\u000acomprehensive conceptualization of the represented knowledge domain. However,\u000amost multimedia ontologies are not exhaustive in terms of role definitions, and\u000ado not incorporate complex role inclusions and role interdependencies. In fact,\u000amost multimedia ontologies do not have a role box at all, and implement only a\u000abasic subset of the available logical constructors. Consequently, their\u000aapplication in multimedia reasoning is limited. To address the above issues,\u000aVidOnt, the very first multimedia ontology with SROIQ(D) expressivity and a\u000aDL-safe ruleset has been introduced for next-generation multimedia reasoning.\u000aIn contrast to the common practice, the formal grounding has been set in one of\u000athe most expressive description logics, and the ontology validated with\u000aindustry-leading reasoners, namely HermiT and FaCT++. This paper also presents\u000abest practices for developing multimedia ontologies, based on my ontology\u000aengineering approach.

VMemory As A Monadic Control Construct In Problem-Solving

VRecent advances in programming languages study and design have established a\u000astandard way of grounding computational systems representation in category\u000atheory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control\u000aand side-effects in functional and imperative languages. This framework can be\u000asuccessfully applied to the investigation of the performance of Artificial\u000aIntelligence (AI) inference and cognitive systems. In this paper, we delineate\u000aa categorical formalisation of memory as a control structure driving\u000aperformance in inference systems. Abstracting away control mechanisms from\u000athree widely used representations of memory in cognitive systems (scripts,\u000aproduction rules and clusters) we explain how categorical triples capture the\u000ainteraction between learning and problem-solving.

VPerformance antipatterns document bad design patterns that have negative\u000ainfluence on system performance. In our previous work we formalized such\u000aantipatterns as logical predicates that predicate on four views: (i) the static\u000aview that captures the software elements (e.g. classes, components) and the\u000astatic relationships among them; (ii) the dynamic view that represents the\u000ainteraction (e.g. messages) that occurs between the software entities elements\u000ato provide the system functionalities; (iii) the deployment view that describes\u000athe hardware elements (e.g. processing nodes) and the mapping of the software\u000aentities onto the hardware platform; (iv) the performance view that collects\u000aspecific performance indices. In this paper we present a lightweight\u000ainfrastructure that is able to detect performance antipatterns at runtime\u000athrough monitoring. The proposed approach precalculates such predicates and\u000aidentifies antipatterns whose static, dynamic and deployment sub-predicates are\u000avalidated by the current system configuration and brings at runtime the\u000averification of performance sub-predicates. The proposed infrastructure\u000aleverages model-driven techniques to generate probes for monitoring the\u000aperformance sub-predicates and detecting antipatterns at runtime.

VA Performance Survey on Stack-based and Register-based Virtual Machines

VVirtual machines have been widely adapted for high-level programming language\u000aimplementations and for providing a degree of platform neutrality. As the\u000aoverall use and adaptation of virtual machines grow, the overall performance of\u000avirtual machines has become a widely-discussed topic. In this paper, we present\u000aa survey on the performance differences of the two most widely adapted types of\u000avirtual machines - the stack-based virtual machine and the register-based\u000avirtual machine - using various benchmark programs. Additionally, we adopted a\u000anew approach of measuring performance by measuring the overall dispatch time,\u000aamount of dispatches, fetch time, and execution time while running benchmarks\u000aon custom-implemented, lightweight virtual machines. Finally, we present two\u000alightweight, custom-designed, Turing-equivalent virtual machines that are\u000aspecifically designed in benchmarking virtual machine performance - the\u000a"Conceptum" stack-based virtual machine, and the "Inertia" register-based\u000avirtual machine. Our result showed that while on average the register machine\u000aspends 20.39% less time in executing benchmarks than the stack machine, the\u000astack-based virtual machine is still faster than the virtual machine regarding\u000athe instruction fetch time.

VAffect Control Processes: Intelligent Affective Interaction using a\u000a  Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
p1987
sg7
VThis paper describes a novel method for building affectively intelligent\u000ahuman-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological insight\u000athat has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,\u000abut has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that\u000aresource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective\u000aconsistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments\u000aabout identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient\u000aaffective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental\u000asentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent\u000awith, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent\u000awith, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This "affect control\u000aprinciple" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In\u000athis paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of\u000athis principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively\u000aintelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain\u000amultiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability\u000adistribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make\u000avalue-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively\u000aintelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,\u000apredicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking\u000aactions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We\u000ademonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our\u000amodel can be used as an emotional "plug-in" for artificially intelligent\u000asystems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice\u000aassistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive\u000adisability.

VSome Operators Associated to Rarita-Schwinger Type Operators
p2032
sg232
VIn this paper we study some operators associated to the Rarita-Schwinger\u000aoperators. They arise from the difference between the Dirac operator and the\u000aRarita-Schwinger operators. These operators are called remaining operators.\u000aThey are based on the Dirac operator and projection operators $I-P_k.$ The\u000afundamental solutions of these operators are harmonic polynomials, homogeneous\u000aof degree $k$. First we study the remaining operators and their representation\u000atheory in Euclidean space. Second, we can extend the remaining operators in\u000aEuclidean space to the sphere under the Cayley transformation.

Approaches that are of specific\u000arelevance to the digital library community include the Metadata Encoding and\u000aTransmission Standard (METS), the IMS Content Packaging XML Binding, and the\u000aXML Formatted Data Units (XFDU) developed by CCSDS Panel 2. The MPEG-21 Digital\u000aItem Declaration (MPEG-21 DID) is another standard specifying the\u000arepresentation of digital assets in XML that, so far, has received little\u000aattention in the digital library community. This article gives a brief insight\u000ainto the MPEG-21 standardization effort, highlights the major characteristics\u000aof the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model, and describes the MPEG-21 Digital Item\u000aDeclaration Language (MPEG-21 DIDL), an XML syntax for the representation of\u000adigital assets based on the MPEG-21 DID Abstract Model.

VModeling Belief in Dynamic Systems, Part II: Revision and Update
p2107
sg7
VThe study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In\u000arecent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief\u000aupdate, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern,\u000a1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework\u000acombines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility,\u000aallowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show\u000ahow belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This\u000aallows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better\u000aunderstand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno\u000aand Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on\u000aseveral strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial\u000aintelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal\u000achange that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including\u000arevision and update.

VWe demonstrate the critical need to identify social situation and instability\u000afactors by acquiring public social satisfaction in this research. However,\u000asubject to the large amount of manual work cost in subject recruitment and data\u000aprocessing, conventional self-reported method cannot be implemented in real\u000atime or applied in large scale investigation. To solve the problem, this paper\u000aproposed an approach to predict users' social satisfaction, especially for the\u000aeconomy-related satisfaction based on users' social media records. We recruited\u000a2,018 Cantonese active participants from each city in Guangdong province\u000aaccording to the population distribution. Both behavioral and linguistic\u000afeatures of the participants are extracted from the online records of social\u000amedia, i.e., Sina Weibo. Regression models are used to predict Sina Weibo\u000ausers' social satisfaction. Furthermore, we consult the economic indexes of\u000aGuangdong in 2012, and calculate the correlations between these indexes and the\u000apredicted social satisfaction. Results indicate that social satisfaction can be\u000asignificantly expressed by specific social media features; local economy\u000asatisfaction has significant positive correlations with several local economy\u000aindexes, which supports that it is reliable to predict social satisfaction from\u000asocial media.

VThe Complexity of Plan Existence and Evaluation in Probabilistic Domains
p2202

VWe examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in\u000aprobabilistic planning domains with succinct representations. We find that many\u000aproblems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: NP,\u000aco-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. Of these, the probabilistic classes PP\u000aand NP^PP are likely to be of special interest in the field of uncertainty in\u000aartificial intelligence and are deserving of additional study. These results\u000asuggest a fruitful direction of future algorithmic development.

VWe focus on the non-locality concerning local copying and local\u000adiscrimination, especially for a set of orthogonal maximally entangled states\u000ain prime dimensional systems, as a study of non-locality of a set of states. As\u000aa result, for such a set, we completely characterize deterministic local\u000acopiability and show that local copying is more difficult than local\u000adiscrimination. From these result, we can conclude that lack algebraic symmetry\u000acauses extra non-locality of a set.

VOPUS: An Efficient Admissible Algorithm for Unordered Search
p2212

VOPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible\u000asearch through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not\u000asignificant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to\u000avery large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of\u000apotential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact\u000alearning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely\u000aspecified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other\u000aareas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.

VThe main prospective aim of modern research related to Artificial\u000aIntelligence is the creation of technical systems that implement the idea of\u000aStrong Intelligence. According our point of view the path to the development of\u000asuch systems comes through the research in the field related to perceptions.\u000aHere we formulate the model of the perception of external world which may be\u000aused for the description of perceptual activity of intelligent beings. We\u000aconsider a number of issues related to the development of the set of patterns\u000awhich will be used by the intelligent system when interacting with environment.\u000aThe key idea of the presented perception model is the idea of subjective\u000areality. The principle of the relativity of perceived world is formulated. It\u000ais shown that this principle is the immediate consequence of the idea of\u000asubjective reality. In this paper we show how the methodology of subjective\u000areality may be used for the creation of different types of Strong AI systems.

VSTIMONT: A core ontology for multimedia stimuli description
p2257
sg1306
VAffective multimedia documents such as images, sounds or videos elicit\u000aemotional responses in exposed human subjects. These stimuli are stored in\u000aaffective multimedia databases and successfully used for a wide variety of\u000aresearch in psychology and neuroscience in areas related to attention and\u000aemotion processing. Although important all affective multimedia databases have\u000anumerous deficiencies which impair their applicability. These problems, which\u000aare brought forward in the paper, result in low recall and precision of\u000amultimedia stimuli retrieval which makes creating emotion elicitation\u000aprocedures difficult and labor-intensive. To address these issues a new core\u000aontology STIMONT is introduced. The STIMONT is written in OWL-DL formalism and\u000aextends W3C EmotionML format with an expressive and formal representation of\u000aaffective concepts, high-level semantics, stimuli document metadata and the\u000aelicited physiology. The advantages of ontology in description of affective\u000amultimedia stimuli are demonstrated in a document retrieval experiment and\u000acompared against contemporary keyword-based querying methods. Also, a software\u000atool Intelligent Stimulus Generator for retrieval of affective multimedia and\u000aconstruction of stimuli sequences is presented.

VMany complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\u000aconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\u000asuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\u000aagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\u000athey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\u000acan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\u000avalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\u000aframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\u000aestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\u000amathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\u000asuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\u000aand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\u000asampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\u000adynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\u000aof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\u000auniversal model for computation.

An understandable\u000aconsciousness definition can be drawn based on the assumption that a pattern\u000arecognition system can recognize its own patterns of activity. The principles,\u000adescriptive modeling and definitions can be a basis for theoretical and applied\u000aresearch on cognitive sciences, particularly at artificial intelligence\u000astudies.

VQuantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing\u000apower over classical computer \u005ccite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum\u000aobject passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum\u000acomputer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed\u000aduality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may\u000aoffer additional computing power \u005ccite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer\u000ais a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer\u000aoffers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming\u000aout of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show\u000athat an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum\u000acomputer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.\u000aA $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical\u000acomputer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit\u000aquantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical\u000acomputer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing\u000aand quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which\u000aa quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These\u000atwo modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the\u000aunsorted database search problem is designed.

VA Model of Pathways to Artificial Superintelligence Catastrophe for Risk\u000a  and Decision Analysis
p2317
sg7
VAn artificial superintelligence (ASI) is artificial intelligence that is\u000asignificantly more intelligent than humans in all respects. While ASI does not\u000acurrently exist, some scholars propose that it could be created sometime in the\u000afuture, and furthermore that its creation could cause a severe global\u000acatastrophe, possibly even resulting in human extinction. Given the high\u000astakes, it is important to analyze ASI risk and factor the risk into decisions\u000arelated to ASI research and development. This paper presents a graphical model\u000aof major pathways to ASI catastrophe, focusing on ASI created via recursive\u000aself-improvement. The model uses the established risk and decision analysis\u000amodeling paradigms of fault trees and influence diagrams in order to depict\u000acombinations of events and conditions that could lead to AI catastrophe, as\u000awell as intervention options that could decrease risks. The events and\u000aconditions include select aspects of the ASI itself as well as the human\u000aprocess of ASI research, development, and management. Model structure is\u000aderived from published literature on ASI risk. The model offers a foundation\u000afor rigorous quantitative evaluation and decision making on the long-term risk\u000aof ASI catastrophe.

VThe interaction between emerging active regions and the pre-existing coronal\u000amagnetic field is important to understand better the mechanisms of storage and\u000arelease of magnetic energy from the convection zone to the high corona. We are\u000aaiming at describing the first steps of the emergence of an active region\u000awithin a pre-existing quiet-Sun corona in terms of the thermal and magnetic\u000astructure. We use unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral coverage from\u000athe Atmospheric Imager Assembly (AIA) and from the Helioseismic and Magnetic\u000aImager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Starting on 30 May\u000a2010 at 17:00 UT and for 8 hours, we follow the emergence of the active region\u000aAR11076 within a quiet-Sun region. Using several SDO/AIA filters covering\u000atemperatures from 50000K to 10 MK, we show that the emerging process is\u000acharacterised by a thermal shield at the interface between the emerging flux\u000aand pre-existing quiet-Sun corona. The active region 11076 can be considered as\u000aa peculiar example of emerging active region as (i) the polarities emerge in a\u000aphotospheric quiet-Sun region near a supergranular-like distribution, (ii) the\u000apolarities forming the bipolar emerging structure do not rotate with respect to\u000aeach other indicating a small amount of twist in the emerging flux bundle.\u000aThere is a thermal shield formed at the interface between the emerging active\u000aregion and the pre-existing quiet-Sun region. The thermal shielding structure\u000adeduced from all SDO/AIA channels exhibits a strong asymmetry between the two\u000apolarities of the active region suggesting that the heating mechanism for one\u000apolarity is more likely to be magnetic reconnection, whilst it is due to\u000aincreasing magnetic pressure for the opposite polarity.

VIrrelevance-based partial MAPs are useful constructs for domain-independent\u000aexplanation using belief networks. We look at two definitions for such partial\u000aMAPs, and prove important properties that are useful in designing algorithms\u000afor computing them effectively. We make use of these properties in modifying\u000aour standard MAP best-first algorithm, so as to handle irrelevance-based\u000apartial MAPs.

VBreaking Value Symmetry
p2357
sg7
VSymmetry is an important factor in solving many constraint satisfaction\u000aproblems. One common type of symmetry is when we have symmetric values. In a\u000arecent series of papers, we have studied methods to break value symmetries. Our\u000aresults identify computational limits on eliminating value symmetry. For\u000ainstance, we prove that pruning all symmetric values is NP-hard in general.\u000aNevertheless, experiments show that much value symmetry can be broken in\u000apractice. These results may be useful to researchers in planning, scheduling\u000aand other areas as value symmetry occurs in many different domains.

VIn the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic\u000atransformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions. While the\u000abenefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks\u000ato our society. After the automation of many production processes and the\u000acreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\u000amoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\u000asociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\u000aimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\u000aand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\u000aparticipatory way and mutually coordinated. Modern information and\u000acommunication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and\u000astrategic benefits. The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous\u000adecision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to\u000abe vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable\u000asocieties, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.

It is shown that the\u000alower and upper approximations of the rough-set model, the lower and upper\u000abounds of incidence calculus, and the belief and plausibility functions all\u000aobey the axioms of an interval structure.

The rapid advancement of Internet\u000atechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\u000aresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\u000acell phones. However, these applications require more security than the present\u000aGSM supports. Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\u000asymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\u000aadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\u000aefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\u000asalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\u000a(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\u000aanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\u000asome known threats observed in conventional GSM security.

VDue to recent advances in data collection techniques, massive amounts of data\u000aare being collected at an extremely fast pace. Also, these data are potentially\u000aunbounded. Boundless streams of data collected from sensors, equipments, and\u000aother data sources are referred to as data streams. Various data mining tasks\u000acan be performed on data streams in search of interesting patterns. This paper\u000astudies a particular data mining task, clustering, which can be used as the\u000afirst step in many knowledge discovery processes. By grouping data streams into\u000ahomogeneous clusters, data miners can learn about data characteristics which\u000acan then be developed into classification models for new data or predictive\u000amodels for unknown events. Recent research addresses the problem of data-stream\u000amining to deal with applications that require processing huge amounts of data\u000asuch as sensor data analysis and financial applications. For such analysis,\u000asingle-pass algorithms that consume a small amount of memory are critical.

VFor many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the\u000astatistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review\u000ahow optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural\u000anetworks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for\u000atwo alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of\u000aGaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural\u000anetworks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for\u000amixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and\u000aaccurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply\u000adecreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve\u000agood performance.

VSolomonoff induction is known to be universal, but incomputable. Its\u000aapproximations, namely, the Minimum Description (or Message) Length (MDL)\u000aprinciples, are adopted in practice in the efficient, but non-universal form.\u000aRecent attempts to bridge this gap leaded to development of the\u000aRepresentational MDL principle that originates from formal decomposition of the\u000atask of induction. In this paper, possible extension of the RMDL principle in\u000athe context of universal intelligence agents is considered, for which\u000aintroduction of representations is shown to be an unavoidable meta-heuristic\u000aand a step toward efficient general intelligence. Hierarchical representations\u000aand model optimization with the use of information-theoretic interpretation of\u000athe adaptive resonance are also discussed.

VModern evolutionary computation utilizes heuristic optimizations based upon\u000aconcepts borrowed from the Darwinian theory of natural selection. We believe\u000athat a vital direction in this field must be algorithms that model the activity\u000aof genomic parasites, such as transposons, in biological evolution. This\u000apublication is our first step in the direction of developing a minimal\u000aassortment of algorithms that simulate the role of genomic parasites.\u000aSpecifically, we started in the domain of genetic algorithms (GA) and selected\u000athe Artificial Ant Problem as a test case. We define these artificial\u000atransposons as a fragment of an ant's code that possesses properties that cause\u000ait to stand apart from the rest. We concluded that artificial transposons,\u000aanalogous to real transposons, are truly capable of acting as intelligent\u000amutators that adapt in response to an evolutionary problem in the course of\u000aco-evolution with their hosts.

We will show that the present swarm can adapt\u000athe size of the population according to the type of image on which it is\u000aevolving and reacting faster to changing images, thus converging more rapidly\u000ato the new desired regions, regulating the number of his image foraging agents.\u000aFinally, we will show evidences that the model can be associated with the\u000aMathematical Morphology Watershed algorithm to improve the segmentation of\u000adigital grey-scale images.

Probabilistic inference systems, in contrast, have lagged behind in\u000asupporting this incrementality typically demanded by problem solvers. The\u000aproblem, we argue, is that the basic task of probabilistic inference is\u000atypically formulated at too large a grain-size. We show how a system built\u000aaround a smaller grain-size inference task can have the desired incrementality\u000aand serve as the basis for a low-level (propositional) probabilistic\u000arepresentation service.

VIn this work, we design a deleting machine and shown that for some given\u000acondition on machine parameters, it gives slightly better result than P-B\u000adeleting machine [5,6]. Also it is shown that for some particular values of the\u000amachine parameters it acts like Pati-Braunstein deleting machine. We also study\u000athe combined effect of cloning and deleting machine, where at first the cloning\u000ais done by some standard cloning machines such as Wootters-Zurek [1] and\u000aBuzek-Hillery [2] cloning machine and then the copy mode is deleted by\u000aPati-Braunstein deleting machine or our prescribed deleting machine. After that\u000awe examine the distortion of the input state and the fidelity of deletion .

VData generation is a key issue in big data benchmarking that aims to generate\u000aapplication-specific data sets to meet the 4V requirements of big data.\u000aSpecifically, big data generators need to generate scalable data (Volume) of\u000adifferent types (Variety) under controllable generation rates (Velocity) while\u000akeeping the important characteristics of raw data (Veracity). This gives rise\u000ato various new challenges about how we design generators efficiently and\u000asuccessfully. To date, most existing techniques can only generate limited types\u000aof data and support specific big data systems such as Hadoop. Hence we develop\u000aa tool, called Big Data Generator Suite (BDGS), to efficiently generate\u000ascalable big data while employing data models derived from real data to\u000apreserve data veracity. The effectiveness of BDGS is demonstrated by developing\u000asix data generators covering three representative data types (structured,\u000asemi-structured and unstructured) and three data sources (text, graph, and\u000atable data).

Moreover, we give an elementary algorithmic procedure which, for an\u000aarbitrary regular language L and a finite non-stochastic tree game with a\u000awinning objective L decides if the game is determined under deterministic\u000astrategies.

VConcerns over the risks associated with advances in Artificial Intelligence\u000ahave prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI,\u000aincluding machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating\u000athe development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally,\u000aevaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices.\u000aThis emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years.\u000aHowever, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging\u000afield of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily\u000afacilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show\u000athat it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves\u000acompetitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific\u000aAI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make\u000aunethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee\u000athe responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we\u000aconclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of\u000aengineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by\u000alegislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to\u000aincrease the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.

VDo Artificial Reinforcement-Learning Agents Matter Morally?
p2572
sg7
VArtificial reinforcement learning (RL) is a widely used technique in\u000aartificial intelligence that provides a general method for training agents to\u000aperform a wide variety of behaviours. RL as used in computer science has\u000astriking parallels to reward and punishment learning in animal and human\u000abrains. I argue that present-day artificial RL agents have a very small but\u000anonzero degree of ethical importance. This is particularly plausible for views\u000aaccording to which sentience comes in degrees based on the abilities and\u000acomplexities of minds, but even binary views on consciousness should assign\u000anonzero probability to RL programs having morally relevant experiences. While\u000aRL programs are not a top ethical priority today, they may become more\u000asignificant in the coming decades as RL is increasingly applied to industry,\u000arobotics, video games, and other areas. I encourage scientists, philosophers,\u000aand citizens to begin a conversation about our ethical duties to reduce the\u000aharm that we inflict on powerless, voiceless RL agents.

VWang's B machines are efficiently universal, as is Hasenjaeger's small\u000a  universal electromechanical toy
p2582
sg651
VIn the 1960's Gisbert Hasenjaeger built Turing Machines from\u000aelectromechanical relays and uniselectors. Recently, Glaschick reverse\u000aengineered the program of one of these machines and found that it is a\u000auniversal Turing machine. In fact, its program uses only four states and two\u000asymbols, making it a very small universal Turing machine. (The machine has\u000athree tapes and a number of other features that are important to keep in mind\u000awhen comparing it to other small universal machines.) Hasenjaeger's machine\u000asimulates Hao Wang's B machines, which were proved universal by Wang.\u000aUnfortunately, Wang's original simulation algorithm suffers from an exponential\u000aslowdown when simulating Turing machines. Hence, via this simulation,\u000aHasenjaeger's machine also has an exponential slowdown when simulating Turing\u000amachines. In this work, we give a new efficient simulation algorithm for Wang's\u000aB machines by showing that they simulate Turing machines with only a polynomial\u000aslowdown. As a second result, we find that Hasenjaeger's machine also\u000aefficiently simulates Turing machines in polynomial time. Thus, Hasenjaeger's\u000amachine is both small and fast. In another application of our result, we show\u000athat Hooper's small universal Turing machine simulates Turing machines in\u000apolynomial time, an exponential improvement.

VArtificial Intelligence in Reverse Supply Chain Management: The State of\u000a  the Art
p2592
sg7
VProduct take-back legislation forces manufacturers to bear the costs of\u000acollection and disposal of products that have reached the end of their useful\u000alives. In order to reduce these costs, manufacturers can consider reuse,\u000aremanufacturing and/or recycling of components as an alternative to disposal.\u000aThe implementation of such alternatives usually requires an appropriate reverse\u000asupply chain management. With the concepts of reverse supply chain are gaining\u000apopularity in practice, the use of artificial intelligence approaches in these\u000aareas is also becoming popular. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to\u000agive an overview of the recent publications concerning the application of\u000aartificial intelligence techniques to reverse supply chain with emphasis on\u000acertain types of product returns.

The behavior of\u000aseveral Bayesian, linear model and default reasoning procedures were examined\u000ain the context of increasing levels of calibration error. The most interesting\u000aresult is that Bayesian procedures tended to output more extreme posterior\u000abelief values (posterior beliefs near 0.0 or 1.0) than other techniques, but\u000athe linear models were relatively less likely to output strong support for an\u000aerroneous conclusion.

The motivation of my article is to augment Chalmers' and to\u000adiscuss some issues not addressed by him, in particular what it could mean for\u000aintelligence to explode. In this course, I will (have to) provide a more\u000acareful treatment of what intelligence actually is, separate speed from\u000aintelligence explosion, compare what super-intelligent participants and\u000aclassical human observers might experience and do, discuss immediate\u000aimplications for the diversity and value of life, consider possible bounds on\u000aintelligence, and contemplate intelligences right at the singularity.

VWe examine perfect information stochastic mean-payoff games - a class of\u000agames containing as special sub-classes the usual mean-payoff games and parity\u000agames. We show that deterministic memoryless strategies that are optimal for\u000adiscounted games with state-dependent discount factors close to 1 are optimal\u000afor priority mean-payoff games establishing a strong link between these two\u000aclasses.

VSocial Network Integration: Towards Constructing the Social Graph
p2702
sg85
VIn this work, we formulate the problem of social network integration. It\u000atakes multiple observed social networks as input and returns an integrated\u000aglobal social graph where each node corresponds to a real person. The key\u000achallenge for social network integration is to discover the correspondences or\u000ainterlinks across different social networks.\u000a  We engaged an in-depth analysis across three online social networks, AMiner,\u000aLinkedin, and Videolectures in order to address what reveals users' social\u000aidentity, whether the social factors consistent across different social\u000anetworks and how we can leverage these information to perform integration.\u000a  We proposed a unified framework for the social network integration task. It\u000acrawls data from multiple social networks and further discovers accounts\u000acorrespond to the same real person from the obtained networks. We use a\u000aprobabilistic model to determine such correspondence, it incorporates features\u000alike the consistency of social status and social ties across different, as well\u000aas one-to-one mapping constraint and logical transitivity to jointly make the\u000aprediction. Empirical experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper we present a\u000aqualitative approach which allows for attaching partially ordered symbolic\u000agrades to logical formulas.

We study the links with related\u000aapproaches and suggest how this framework might be used to manage both\u000auncertain and incomplere knowledge.

VA Survey on Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining for MOOCs
p2722
sg7
VMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained tremendous popularity in the\u000alast few years. Thanks to MOOCs, millions of learners from all over the world\u000ahave taken thousands of high-quality courses for free. Putting together an\u000aexcellent MOOC ecosystem is a multidisciplinary endeavour that requires\u000acontributions from many different fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data\u000amining (DM) are two such fields that have played a significant role in making\u000aMOOCs what they are today. By exploiting the vast amount of data generated by\u000alearners engaging in MOOCs, DM improves our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem\u000aand enables MOOC practitioners to deliver better courses. Similarly, AI,\u000asupported by DM, can greatly improve student experience and learning outcomes.\u000aIn this survey paper, we first review the state-of-the-art artificial\u000aintelligence and data mining research applied to MOOCs, emphasising the use of\u000aAI and DM tools and techniques to improve student engagement, learning\u000aoutcomes, and our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem. We then offer an\u000aoverview of key trends and important research to carry out in the fields of AI\u000aand DM so that MOOCs can reach their full potential.

VOne of the most difficult aspects of modeling complex dilemmas in\u000adecision-analytic terms is composing a diagram of relevance relations from a\u000aset of domain concepts. Decision models in domains such as medicine, however,\u000aexhibit certain prototypical patterns that can guide the modeling process.\u000aMedical concepts can be classified according to semantic types that have\u000acharacteristic positions and typical roles in an influence-diagram model. We\u000ahave developed a graph-grammar production system that uses such inherent\u000ainterrelationships among medical terms to facilitate the modeling of medical\u000adecisions.

VMeasurements of collective machine intelligence
p2737
sg7
VIndependent from the still ongoing research in measuring individual\u000aintelligence, we anticipate and provide a framework for measuring collective\u000aintelligence. Collective intelligence refers to the idea that several\u000aindividuals can collaborate in order to achieve high levels of intelligence. We\u000apresent thus some ideas on how the intelligence of a group can be measured and\u000asimulate such tests. We will however focus here on groups of artificial\u000aintelligence agents (i.e., machines). We will explore how a group of agents is\u000aable to choose the appropriate problem and to specialize for a variety of\u000atasks. This is a feature which is an important contributor to the increase of\u000aintelligence in a group (apart from the addition of more agents and the\u000aimprovement due to common decision making). Our results reveal some interesting\u000aresults about how (collective) intelligence can be modeled, about how\u000acollective intelligence tests can be designed and about the underlying dynamics\u000aof collective intelligence. As it will be useful for our simulations, we\u000aprovide also some improvements of the threshold allocation model originally\u000aused in the area of swarm intelligence but further generalized here.

We present two modal logics that can be used to represent and\u000areason with qualitative statements of possibility and necessity. Within this\u000amodal framework, we are able to identify interesting relationships between\u000apossibilistic logic, beliefs and conditionals. In particular, the most natural\u000aconditional definable via possibilistic means for default reasoning is\u000aidentical to Pearl's conditional for e-semantics.

VA Probabilistic Network of Predicates

VBayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing independence\u000arelationships among a set of random variables. A random variable can be\u000aregarded as a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive propositions. We argue\u000athat there are several drawbacks resulting from the propositional nature and\u000aacyclic structure of Bayesian networks. To remedy these shortcomings, we\u000apropose a probabilistic network where nodes represent unary predicates and\u000awhich may contain directed cycles. The proposed representation allows us to\u000arepresent domain knowledge in a single static network even though we cannot\u000adetermine the instantiations of the predicates before hand. The ability to deal\u000awith cycles also enables us to handle cyclic causal tendencies and to recognize\u000arecursive plans.

VWe study the emergence of magnetic flux from the near-surface layers of the\u000asolar convection zone into the photosphere. To model magnetic flux emergence,\u000awe carried out a set of numerical radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations.\u000aOur simulations take into account the effects of compressibility, energy\u000aexchange via radiative transfer, and partial ionization in the equation of\u000astate. All these physical ingredients are essential for a proper treatment of\u000athe problem. Furthermore, the inclusion of radiative transfer allows us to\u000adirectly compare the simulation results with actual observations of emerging\u000aflux. We find that the interaction between the magnetic flux tube and the\u000aexternal flow field has an important influence on the emergent morphology of\u000athe magnetic field. Depending on the initial properties of the flux tube (e.g.\u000afield strength, twist, entropy etc.), the emergence process can also modify the\u000alocal granulation pattern. The emergence of magnetic flux tubes with a flux of\u000a$10^{19}$ Mx disturbs the granulation and leads to the transient appearance of\u000aa dark lane, which is coincident with upflowing material. These results are\u000aconsistent with observed properties of emerging magnetic flux.

VComputer-Assisted Program Reasoning Based on a Relational Semantics of\u000a  Programs
p2867
sg62
VWe present an approach to program reasoning which inserts between a program\u000aand its verification conditions an additional layer, the denotation of the\u000aprogram expressed in a declarative form. The program is first translated into\u000aits denotation from which subsequently the verification conditions are\u000agenerated. However, even before (and independently of) any verification\u000aattempt, one may investigate the denotation itself to get insight into the\u000a"semantic essence" of the program, in particular to see whether the denotation\u000aindeed gives reason to believe that the program has the expected behavior.\u000aErrors in the program and in the meta-information may thus be detected and\u000afixed prior to actually performing the formal verification. More concretely,\u000afollowing the relational approach to program semantics, we model the effect of\u000aa program as a binary relation on program states. A formal calculus is devised\u000ato derive from a program a logic formula that describes this relation and is\u000asubject for inspection and manipulation. We have implemented this idea in a\u000acomprehensive form in the RISC ProgramExplorer, a new program reasoning\u000aenvironment for educational purposes which encompasses the previously developed\u000aRISC ProofNavigator as an interactive proving assistant.

VPerspectives for Strong Artificial Life

VThis text introduces the twin deadlocks of strong artificial life.\u000aConceptualization of life is a deadlock both because of the existence of a\u000acontinuum between the inert and the living, and because we only know one\u000ainstance of life. Computationalism is a second deadlock since it remains a\u000amatter of faith. Nevertheless, artificial life realizations quickly progress\u000aand recent constructions embed an always growing set of the intuitive\u000aproperties of life. This growing gap between theory and realizations should\u000asooner or later crystallize in some kind of paradigm shift and then give clues\u000ato break the twin deadlocks.

VMultiagent systems consist of agents that locally exchange information\u000athrough a physical network subject to a graph topology. Current control methods\u000afor networked multiagent systems assume the knowledge of graph topologies in\u000aorder to design distributed control laws for achieving desired global system\u000abehaviors. However, this assumption may not be valid for situations where graph\u000atopologies are subject to uncertainties either due to changes in the physical\u000anetwork or the presence of modeling errors especially for multiagent systems\u000ainvolving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this\u000astandpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent\u000asystems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a\u000acontroller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in\u000aresponse to system variations. Specifically, we analytically show that the\u000aproposed controller drives the trajectories of a networked multiagent system\u000asubject to a graph topology with time-varying uncertainties to a close\u000aneighborhood of the trajectories of a given reference model having a desired\u000agraph topology. As a special case, we also show that a networked multi-agent\u000asystem subject to a graph topology with constant uncertainties asymptotically\u000aconverges to the trajectories of a given reference model. Although the main\u000aresult of this paper is presented in the context of average consensus problem,\u000athe proposed framework can be used for many other problems related to networked\u000amultiagent systems with uncertain graph topologies.

V8-Valent Fuzzy Logic for Iris Recognition and Biometry

In other words, consistent enrollment is\u000amandatory in order to preserve system consistency. A fuzzy 3-valued\u000adisambiguated model of iris recognition is proposed and analyzed in terms of\u000acompleteness, consistency, user comfort and biometric safety. It is also shown\u000ahere that the fuzzy 3-valued model of iris recognition is hosted by an 8-valued\u000aBoolean algebra of modulo 8 integers that represents the computational\u000aformalization in which a biometric system (a software agent) can achieve the\u000aartificial understanding of iris recognition in a logically consistent manner.

In this paper, we design an ozone level alarm system (OLP) for\u000aIsfahan city and test it through the real word data from 1-1-2000 to 7-6-2011.\u000aWe propose a computer based system with three inputs and single output.

And the output of the system is the predicted O3 of\u000athe next day and the alarm massages. A developed artificial intelligence (AI)\u000aalgorithm is applied to determine the output, based on the inputs variables.\u000aFor this issue, AI models, including supervised brain emotional learning (BEL),\u000aadaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks\u000a(ANNs), are compared in order to find the best model. The simulation of the\u000aproposed system shows that it can be used successfully in prediction of major\u000acities ozone level.

The associated\u000aconditional logic, compatible with conditional probability evaluations, is\u000anon-monotonic relative to additional evidence. Computational aspects of\u000aconditional probability logic are mentioned. The importance of this development\u000alies on its role to provide a conceptual basis for various forms of evidence\u000acombination and on its significance to unify multi-valued and non-monotonic\u000alogics

sg7
VWe present a generalization of the local expression language used in the\u000aSymbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) approach to inference in belief nets\u000a[1l, [8]. The local expression language in SPI is the language in which the\u000adependence of a node on its antecedents is described. The original language\u000arepresented the dependence as a single monolithic conditional probability\u000adistribution. The extended language provides a set of operators (*, +, and -)\u000awhich can be used to specify methods for combining partial conditional\u000adistributions. As one instance of the utility of this extension, we show how\u000athis extended language can be used to capture the semantics, representational\u000aadvantages, and inferential complexity advantages of the "noisy or"\u000arelationship.

In this paper we raise the question of\u000awhether, on the contrary, it could be considered a key tool in increasing\u000aintelligence in biological structures. A possible way of answering this\u000aquestion in a mathematical context is shown, formulating a proposition that\u000asuggests a link between intelligence and contradiction.\u000a  A concrete approach is presented in the well-defined setting of cellular\u000aautomata. Here we define the models of ``observer'', ``entity'',\u000a``environment'', ``intelligence'' and ``contradiction''. These definitions,\u000awhich roughly correspond to the common meaning of these words, allow us to\u000adeduce a simple but strong result about these concepts in an unbiased,\u000amathematical manner. Evidence for a real-world counterpart to the demonstrated\u000aformal link between intelligence and contradiction is provided by three\u000acomputational experiments.

VIntercausal reasoning is a common inference pattern involving probabilistic\u000adependence of causes of an observed common effect. The sign of this dependence\u000ais captured by a qualitative property called product synergy. The current\u000adefinition of product synergy is insufficient for intercausal reasoning where\u000athere are additional uninstantiated causes of the common effect. We propose a\u000anew definition of product synergy and prove its adequacy for intercausal\u000areasoning with direct and indirect evidence for the common effect. The new\u000adefinition is based on a new property matrix half positive semi-definiteness, a\u000aweakened form of matrix positive semi-definiteness.

In particular\u000aexpressing Bayes Theorem in terms of the information contents associated to its\u000aprobabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the\u000asystem by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space.\u000aIt is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information\u000asources are generated: the Information Content Associated to the Evidence that\u000aalways introduces positive information, and the Information Content Associated\u000ato the Bayes Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the\u000aevidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and\u000athe likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference\u000abetween these two mentioned information contents, the information that arrives\u000ato a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric,\u000agiven by the difference of the two mentioned information contents called\u000atransfer information content which measures the information transferred to each\u000aof the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem\u000a(MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed\u000aallows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the\u000acounterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information.\u000aThe implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to\u000athe emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience\u000a(particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding) are proposed as\u000afurther work.

VMinimally Naturalistic Artificial Intelligence
p3047
sg7
VThe rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has re-energized\u000aresearch into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of\u000adomain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to\u000aterms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure\u000aof the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by\u000aaligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we\u000astand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad\u000areading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally\u000aoptimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This\u000afollows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate\u000adata, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an\u000ainductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers\u000aperformance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may\u000aposit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of\u000aits environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this\u000aagent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative\u000aenvironments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment\u000aas being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is\u000aobviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we\u000afurther constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI\u000ain terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of\u000athis is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the\u000astatistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.

p3052

VThe fundamental updating process in the transferable belief model is related\u000ato the concept of specialization and can be described by a specialization\u000amatrix. The degree of belief in the truth of a proposition is a degree of\u000ajustified support. The Principle of Minimal Commitment implies that one should\u000anever give more support to the truth of a proposition than justified. We show\u000athat Dempster's rule of conditioning corresponds essentially to the least\u000acommitted specialization, and that Dempster's rule of combination results\u000aessentially from commutativity requirements. The concept of generalization,\u000adual to thc concept of specialization, is described.

VAlgorithms and Complexity Results for Persuasive Argumentation
p3067
sg7
VThe study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as\u000aintroduced by Dung (Artificial Intelligence 177, 1995) has become one of the\u000amost active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A\u000amain issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable\u000asets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J.\u000aLogic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung's framework. It takes into account the\u000arelative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an\u000aaudience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect\u000ato some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to\u000aall audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively\u000aaccepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the\u000aproblems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main\u000acomputational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In\u000athis paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems\u000afor which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes\u000aare defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying\u000agraphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the\u000aacceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that\u000awhere conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).

VCognitive Bias for Universal Algorithmic Intelligence
p3082
sg7
VExisting theoretical universal algorithmic intelligence models are not\u000apractically realizable. More pragmatic approach to artificial general\u000aintelligence is based on cognitive architectures, which are, however,\u000anon-universal in sense that they can construct and use models of the\u000aenvironment only from Turing-incomplete model spaces. We believe that the way\u000ato the real AGI consists in bridging the gap between these two approaches. This\u000ais possible if one considers cognitive functions as a "cognitive bias" (priors\u000aand search heuristics) that should be incorporated into the models of universal\u000aalgorithmic intelligence without violating their universality. Earlier reported\u000aresults suiting this approach and its overall feasibility are discussed on the\u000aexample of perception, planning, knowledge representation, attention, theory of\u000amind, language, and some others.

VThe subsurface properties of active regions prior to their appearance at the\u000asolar surface may shed light on the process of active region formation.\u000aHelioseismic holography has been applied to samples taken from two populations\u000aof regions on the Sun (pre-emergence and without emergence), each sample having\u000aover 100 members, that were selected to minimize systematic bias, as described\u000ain Paper I (Leka et al., 2012). Paper II (Birch et al., 2012) showed that there\u000aare statistically significant signatures in the average helioseismic properties\u000athat precede the formation of an active region. This paper describes a more\u000adetailed analysis of the samples of pre-emergence regions and regions without\u000aemergence, based on discriminant analysis. The property that is best able to\u000adistinguish the populations is found to be the surface magnetic field, even a\u000aday before the emergence time. However, after accounting for the correlations\u000abetween the surface field and the quantities derived from helioseismology,\u000athere is still evidence of a helioseismic precursor to active region emergence\u000athat is present for at least a day prior to emergence.

VUnderstanding and using natural processes for intelligent functionalities,\u000areferred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a\u000avariety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence\u000aand decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we\u000asuccessfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the\u000atwo-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement\u000alearning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a\u000ahierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and\u000adecision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically,\u000athe four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a\u000atwo-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted\u000ain order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.\u000aIn the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.\u000aThe optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,\u000aconflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while\u000awhat we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the\u000aprobabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the\u000aoptimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the\u000aexploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon\u000aintelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence\u000aas well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities.

VWe examine natural expectations on communication performance using MPI\u000aderived datatypes in comparison to the baseline, "raw" performance of\u000acommunicating simple, non-contiguous data layouts. We show that common MPI\u000alibraries sometimes violate these datatype performance expectations, and\u000adiscuss reasons why this happens, but also show cases where MPI libraries\u000aperform well. Our findings are in many ways surprising and disappointing.\u000aFirst, the performance of derived datatypes is sometimes worse than the\u000asemantically equivalent packing and unpacking using the corresponding MPI\u000afunctionality. Second, the communication performance equivalence stated in the\u000aMPI standard between a single contiguous datatype and the repetition of its\u000aconstituent datatype does not hold universally. Third, the heuristics that are\u000atypically employed by MPI libraries at type-commit time are insufficient to\u000aenforce natural performance guidelines, and better type normalization\u000aheuristics may have a significant performance impact. We show cases where all\u000athe MPI type constructors are necessary to achieve the expected performance for\u000acertain data layouts. We describe our benchmarking approach to verify the\u000adatatype performance guidelines, and present extensive verification results for\u000adifferent MPI libraries.

VA Framework for Searching for General Artificial Intelligence

VThere is a significant lack of unified approaches to building generally\u000aintelligent machines. The majority of current artificial intelligence research\u000aoperates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without considering\u000athe importance of the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and\u000aunify principles that guide the basis of our development of general artificial\u000aintelligence. These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a\u000atool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as\u000athe ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help\u000asteer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying,\u000ameasuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level\u000aintelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both\u000aimplementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable\u000away to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary\u000aconditions in the search for general artificial intelligence. We believe that\u000asuch a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together\u000adefinitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to\u000acollaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this\u000acentury.

VCloud Computing has become another buzzword after Web 2.0. However, there are\u000adozens of different definitions for Cloud Computing and there seems to be no\u000aconsensus on what a Cloud is. On the other hand, Cloud Computing is not a\u000acompletely new concept; it has intricate connection to the relatively new but\u000athirteen-year established Grid Computing paradigm, and other relevant\u000atechnologies such as utility computing, cluster computing, and distributed\u000asystems in general. This paper strives to compare and contrast Cloud Computing\u000awith Grid Computing from various angles and give insights into the essential\u000acharacteristics of both.

VA Pseudo DNA Cryptography Method
p3192
sg492
VThe DNA cryptography is a new and very promising direction in cryptography\u000aresearch. DNA can be used in cryptography for storing and transmitting the\u000ainformation, as well as for computation. Although in its primitive stage, DNA\u000acryptography is shown to be very effective. Currently, several DNA computing\u000aalgorithms are proposed for quite some cryptography, cryptanalysis and\u000asteganography problems, and they are very powerful in these areas. However, the\u000ause of the DNA as a means of cryptography has high tech lab requirements and\u000acomputational limitations, as well as the labor intensive extrapolation means\u000aso far. These make the efficient use of DNA cryptography difficult in the\u000asecurity world now. Therefore, more theoretical analysis should be performed\u000abefore its real applications.\u000a  In this project, We do not intended to utilize real DNA to perform the\u000acryptography process; rather, We will introduce a new cryptography method based\u000aon central dogma of molecular biology. Since this method simulates some\u000acritical processes in central dogma, it is a pseudo DNA cryptography method.\u000aThe theoretical analysis and experiments show this method to be efficient in\u000acomputation, storage and transmission; and it is very powerful against certain\u000aattacks. Thus, this method can be of many uses in cryptography, such as an\u000aenhancement insecurity and speed to the other cryptography methods. There are\u000aalso extensions and variations to this method, which have enhanced security,\u000aeffectiveness and applicability.

Many existing algorithms developed for\u000alearning and inference in DBNs are applicable to probabilistic language\u000amodeling. To demonstrate the potential of DBNs for natural language processing,\u000awe employ a DBN in an information extraction task. We show how to assemble\u000awealth of emerging linguistic instruments for shallow parsing, syntactic and\u000asemantic tagging, morphological decomposition, named entity recognition etc. in\u000aorder to incrementally build a robust information extraction system. Our method\u000aoutperforms previously published results on an established benchmark domain.

VThe Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational\u000amodel which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to\u000athe Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability\u000alevel and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.\u000aHowever, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation\u000ausing real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this\u000acase. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers\u000awere equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown\u000athat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to\u000aComputable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a\u000acomputational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the\u000aconnections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by\u000ashowing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can\u000abe simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than\u000athose used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about\u000abounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as\u000aspace-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.

VTo capture the uncertainty of information or knowledge in information\u000asystems, various information granulations, also known as knowledge\u000agranulations, have been proposed. Recently, several axiomatic definitions of\u000ainformation granulation have been introduced. In this paper, we try to improve\u000athese axiomatic definitions and give a universal construction of information\u000agranulation by relating information granulations with a class of functions of\u000amultiple variables. We show that the improved axiomatic definition has some\u000aconcrete information granulations in the literature as instances.

Uncertain rules with\u000abounds for probabilities and explicit conditional independences can be\u000amaintained incrementally. The basic inference mechanism relies on local bounds\u000apropagation, implementable by deductive databases with a bottom-up fixpoint\u000aevaluation. In situations, where no precise bounds are deducible, it can be\u000acombined with simple operations research techniques on a local scope. In\u000aparticular, we provide new precise analytical bounds for probabilistic\u000aentailment.

VThis paper discusses the computation of derivatives for optimization problems\u000agoverned by linear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations (PDEs)\u000athat are discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method. An efficient\u000aand accurate computation of these derivatives is important, for instance, in\u000ainverse problems and optimal control problems. This computation is usually\u000abased on an adjoint PDE system, and the question addressed in this paper is how\u000athe discretization of this adjoint system should relate to the dG\u000adiscretization of the hyperbolic state equation. Adjoint-based derivatives can\u000aeither be computed before or after discretization; these two options are often\u000areferred to as the optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize\u000aapproaches. We discuss the relation between these two options for dG\u000adiscretizations in space and Runge-Kutta time integration. Discretely exact\u000adiscretizations for several hyperbolic optimization problems are derived,\u000aincluding the advection equation, Maxwell's equations and the coupled\u000aelastic-acoustic wave equation. We find that the discrete adjoint equation\u000ainherits a natural dG discretization from the discretization of the state\u000aequation and that the expressions for the discretely exact gradient often have\u000ato take into account contributions from element faces. For the coupled\u000aelastic-acoustic wave equation, the correctness and accuracy of our derivative\u000aexpressions are illustrated by comparisons with finite difference gradients.\u000aThe results show that a straightforward discretization of the continuous\u000agradient differs from the discretely exact gradient, and thus is not consistent\u000awith the discretized objective. This inconsistency may cause difficulties in\u000athe convergence of gradient based algorithms for solving optimization problems.

The problem is especially acute when we need to consider\u000aartificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper\u000awe approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known\u000ainformal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and\u000aextract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to\u000aproduce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines.

VFence - An Efficient Parser with Ambiguity Support for Model-Driven\u000a  Language Specification
p3352
sg436
VModel-based language specification has applications in the implementation of\u000alanguage processors, the design of domain-specific languages, model-driven\u000asoftware development, data integration, text mining, natural language\u000aprocessing, and corpus-based induction of models. Model-based language\u000aspecification decouples language design from language processing and, unlike\u000atraditional grammar-driven approaches, which constrain language designers to\u000aspecific kinds of grammars, it needs general parser generators able to deal\u000awith ambiguities. In this paper, we propose Fence, an efficient bottom-up\u000aparsing algorithm with lexical and syntactic ambiguity support that enables the\u000ause of model-based language specification in practice.

VThe Compound Class of Linear Failure Rate-Power Series Distributions:\u000a  Model, Properties and Applications
p3357
sg216
VWe introduce in this paper a new class of distributions which generalizes the\u000alinear failure rate (LFR) distribution and is obtained by compounding the LFR\u000adistribution and power series (PS) class of distributions. This new class of\u000adistributions is called the linear failure rate-power series (LFRPS)\u000adistributions and contains some new distributions such as linear failure rate\u000ageometric (LFRG) distribution, linear failure rate Poisson (LFRP) distribution,\u000alinear failure rate logarithmic (LFRL) distribution, linear failure rate\u000abinomial (LFRB) distribution and Raylight-power series (RPS) class of\u000adistributions. Some former works such as exponential-power series (EPS) class\u000aof distributions, exponential geometric (EG) distribution, exponential Poisson\u000a(EP) distribution and exponential logarithmic (EL) distribution are special\u000acases of the new proposed model.\u000a  The ability of the LFRPS class of distributions is in covering five possible\u000ahazard rate function i.e., increasing, decreasing, upside-down bathtub\u000a(unimodal), bathtub and increasing-decreasing-increasing shaped. Several\u000aproperties of the LFRPS distributions such as moments, maximum likelihood\u000aestimation procedure via an EM-algorithm and inference for a large sample, are\u000adiscussed in this paper. In order to show the flexibility and potentiality of\u000athe new class of distributions, the fitted results of the new class of\u000adistributions and some its submodels are compared using a real data set.

For the probabilistic case, the class of\u000aprobability models encoded by valuation networks includes undirected graph\u000amodels, directed acyclic graph models, directed balloon graph models, and\u000arecursive causal graph models.

VTo model combinatorial decision problems involving uncertainty and\u000aprobability, we introduce stochastic constraint programming. Stochastic\u000aconstraint programs contain both decision variables (which we can set) and\u000astochastic variables (which follow a probability distribution). They combine\u000atogether the best features of traditional constraint satisfaction, stochastic\u000ainteger programming, and stochastic satisfiability. We give a semantics for\u000astochastic constraint programs, and propose a number of complete algorithms and\u000aapproximation procedures. Finally, we discuss a number of extensions of\u000astochastic constraint programming to relax various assumptions like the\u000aindependence between stochastic variables, and compare with other approaches\u000afor decision making under uncertainty.

VQuantifying Morphological Computation based on an Information\u000a  Decomposition of the Sensorimotor Loop
p3475
sg7
VThe question how an agent is affected by its embodiment has attracted growing\u000aattention in recent years. A new field of artificial intelligence has emerged,\u000awhich is based on the idea that intelligence cannot be understood without\u000ataking into account embodiment. We believe that a formal approach to\u000aquantifying the embodiment's effect on the agent's behaviour is beneficial to\u000athe fields of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The contribution of\u000aan agent's body and environment to its behaviour is also known as morphological\u000acomputation. Therefore, in this work, we propose a quantification of\u000amorphological computation, which is based on an information decomposition of\u000athe sensorimotor loop into shared, unique and synergistic information. In\u000anumerical simulation based on a formal representation of the sensorimotor loop,\u000awe show that the unique information of the body and environment is a good\u000ameasure for morphological computation. The results are compared to our\u000apreviously derived quantification of morphological computation.

VLearning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be\u000aintelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically,\u000alearning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning\u000afalling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are\u000ain many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these\u000ainterdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines\u000ainductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a\u000apropositional setting.

VExact Phase Transitions in Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems
p3543

VIn this paper we propose a new type of random CSP model, called Model RB,\u000awhich is a revision to the standard Model B. It is proved that phase\u000atransitions from a region where almost all problems are satisfiable to a region\u000awhere almost all problems are unsatisfiable do exist for Model RB as the number\u000aof variables approaches infinity. Moreover, the critical values at which the\u000aphase transitions occur are also known exactly. By relating the hardness of\u000aModel RB to Model B, it is shown that there exist a lot of hard instances in\u000aModel RB.

VMobile Multimedia Recommendation in Smart Communities: A Survey
p3563
sg1306
VDue to the rapid growth of internet broadband access and proliferation of\u000amodern mobile devices, various types of multimedia (e.g. text, images, audios\u000aand videos) have become ubiquitously available anytime. Mobile device users\u000ausually store and use multimedia contents based on their personal interests and\u000apreferences. Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have however\u000aintroduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. In order to\u000atackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that\u000arecommend multimedia for mobile users. In this survey paper, we examine the\u000aimportance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of\u000athree smart communities, namely, mobile social learning, mobile event guide and\u000acontext-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that\u000athe implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems\u000acan improve mobile multimedia recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still\u000achallenges and open issues such as the incorporation of context and social\u000aproperties, which need to be tackled in order to generate accurate and\u000atrustworthy mobile multimedia recommendations.

VSocial Browsing & Information Filtering in Social Media
p3568
sg85
VSocial networks are a prominent feature of many social media sites, a new\u000ageneration of Web sites that allow users to create and share content. Sites\u000asuch as Digg, Flickr, and Del.icio.us allow users to designate others as\u000a"friends" or "contacts" and provide a single-click interface to track friends'\u000aactivity. How are these social networks used? Unlike pure social networking\u000asites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their\u000aonline professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for\u000athe most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships.\u000aInstead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express\u000atheir tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new\u000asubmissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate\u000anew ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing. Through\u000aan extensive analysis of data from Digg and Flickr, we show that social\u000abrowsing is one of the primary usage modalities on these social media sites.\u000aThis finding has implications for how social media sites rate and personalize\u000acontent.

VWe present a novel framework for integrating prior knowledge into\u000adiscriminative classifiers. Our framework allows discriminative classifiers\u000asuch as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to utilize prior knowledge specified in\u000athe generative setting. The dual objective of fitting the data and respecting\u000aprior knowledge is formulated as a bilevel program, which is solved\u000a(approximately) via iterative application of second-order cone programming. To\u000atest our approach, we consider the problem of using WordNet (a semantic\u000adatabase of English language) to improve low-sample classification accuracy of\u000anewsgroup categorization. WordNet is viewed as an approximate, but readily\u000aavailable source of background knowledge, and our framework is capable of\u000autilizing it in a flexible way.

VComputational Evidence that Self-regulation of Creativity is Good for\u000a  Society
p3603
sg1427
VExcess individual creativity can be detrimental to society because creators\u000ainvest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Moreover, a\u000aproportion of individuals can benefit from creativity without being creative\u000athemselves by copying creators. We hypothesized that (1) societies increase\u000atheir rate of cultural evolution by tempering the novelty-generating effects of\u000acreativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation, and (2) this is\u000acarried out by selectively rewarding and punishing creativity according to the\u000avalue of the individuals' creative outputs. We tested this using an agent-based\u000amodel of cultural evolution in which each agent self-regulated its\u000ainvention-to-imitation ratio as a function of the fitness of its cultural\u000aoutputs. In self-regulating societies, agents segregated into creators and\u000aimitators. The mean fitness of cultural outputs was higher than in\u000anon-self-regulating societies, and changes in diversity were rapider and more\u000apronounced. We discuss limitations and possible social implications of our\u000afindings.

p3623
sg62
VProgram understanding is an important aspect in Software Maintenance and\u000aReengineering. Understanding the program is related to execution behaviour and\u000arelationship of variable involved in the program. The task of finding all\u000astatements in a program that directly or indirectly influence the value for an\u000aoccurrence of a variable gives the set of statements that can affect the value\u000aof a variable at some point in a program is called a program slice. Program\u000aslicing is a technique for extracting parts of computer programs by tracing the\u000aprograms' control and data flow related to some data item. This technique is\u000aapplicable in various areas such as debugging, program comprehension and\u000aunderstanding, program integration, cohesion measurement, re-engineering,\u000amaintenance, testing where it is useful to be able to focus on relevant parts\u000aof large programs. This paper focuses on the various slicing techniques (not\u000alimited to) like static slicing, quasi static slicing, dynamic slicing and\u000aconditional slicing. This paper also includes various methods in performing the\u000aslicing like forward slicing, backward slicing, syntactic slicing and semantic\u000aslicing. The slicing of a program is carried out using Java which is a object\u000aoriented programming language.

VWe propose to use thought-provoking children's questions (TPCQs), namely\u000aHighlights BrainPlay questions, to drive artificial intelligence research.\u000aThese questions are designed to stimulate thought and learning in children, and\u000athey can be used to do the same thing in AI systems. We introduce the TPCQ\u000atask, which consists of taking a TPCQ question as input and producing as output\u000aboth (1) answers to the question and (2) learned generalizations. We discuss\u000ahow BrainPlay questions stimulate learning. We analyze 244 BrainPlay questions,\u000aand we report statistics on question type, question class, answer cardinality,\u000aanswer class, types of knowledge needed, and types of reasoning needed. We find\u000athat BrainPlay questions span many aspects of intelligence. We envision an AI\u000asystem based on the society of mind (Minsky 1986; 2006) consisting of a\u000amultilevel architecture with diverse resources that run in parallel to jointly\u000aanswer and learn from questions. Because the answers to BrainPlay questions and\u000athe generalizations learned from them are often highly open-ended, we suggest\u000ausing human judges for evaluation.

VIs Intelligence Artificial?
p3638
sg7
VOur understanding of intelligence is directed primarily at the level of human\u000abeings. This paper attempts to give a more unifying definition that can be\u000aapplied to the natural world in general. The definition would be used more to\u000averify a degree of intelligence, not to quantify it and might help when making\u000ajudgements on the matter. A version of an accepted test for AI is then put\u000aforward as the 'acid test' for Artificial Intelligence itself. It might be what\u000aa free-thinking program or robot would try to achieve. Recent work by the\u000aauthor on AI has been more from a direction of mechanical processes, or ones\u000athat might operate automatically. This paper will not try to question the idea\u000aof intelligence, in the sense of a pro-active or conscious event, but try to\u000aput it into a more passive, automatic and mechanical context. The paper also\u000asuggests looking at intelligence and consciousness as being slightly different.

The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics\u000afor logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.\u000a  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for\u000anormal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an\u000ainterpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper\u000ashows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of\u000athe rules.\u000a  The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and\u000acoincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic\u000acharacterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone\u000aaggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).\u000a  Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using\u000aavailable answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that\u000ais capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g.,\u000arecursively defined) aggregates.

VIn the probabilistic approach to uncertainty management the input knowledge\u000ais usually represented by means of some probability distributions. In this\u000apaper we assume that the input knowledge is given by two discrete conditional\u000aprobability distributions, represented by two stochastic matrices P and Q. The\u000aconsistency of the knowledge base is analyzed. Coherence conditions and\u000aexplicit formulas for the extension to marginal distributions are obtained in\u000asome special cases.

VWith the advances in information technology (IT) criminals are using\u000acyberspace to commit numerous cyber crimes. Cyber infrastructures are highly\u000avulnerable to intrusions and other threats. Physical devices and human\u000aintervention are not sufficient for monitoring and protection of these\u000ainfrastructures; hence, there is a need for more sophisticated cyber defense\u000asystems that need to be flexible, adaptable and robust, and able to detect a\u000awide variety of threats and make intelligent real-time decisions. Numerous\u000abio-inspired computing methods of Artificial Intelligence have been\u000aincreasingly playing an important role in cyber crime detection and prevention.\u000aThe purpose of this study is to present advances made so far in the field of\u000aapplying AI techniques for combating cyber crimes, to demonstrate how these\u000atechniques can be an effective tool for detection and prevention of cyber\u000aattacks, as well as to give the scope for future work.

VIntelligent Systems: Architectures and Perspectives
p3713

VThe integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome\u000aindividual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the\u000ahybridization or fusion of these techniques has, in recent years, contributed\u000ato a large number of new intelligent system designs. Computational intelligence\u000ais an innovative framework for constructing intelligent hybrid architectures\u000ainvolving Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), Probabilistic\u000aReasoning (PR) and derivative free optimization techniques such as Evolutionary\u000aComputation (EC). Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an ad\u000ahoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains.\u000aDue to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the\u000avarious hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance\u000acomparatively. This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for\u000aintegrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of\u000adifferent hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC\u000asystems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end.

VBelief Revision in Probability Theory
p3728

VIn a probability-based reasoning system, Bayes' theorem and its variations\u000aare often used to revise the system's beliefs. However, if the explicit\u000aconditions and the implicit conditions of probability assignments `me properly\u000adistinguished, it follows that Bayes' theorem is not a generally applicable\u000arevision rule. Upon properly distinguishing belief revision from belief\u000aupdating, we see that Jeffrey's rule and its variations are not revision rules,\u000aeither. Without these distinctions, the limitation of the Bayesian approach is\u000aoften ignored or underestimated. Revision, in its general form, cannot be done\u000ain the Bayesian approach, because a probability distribution function alone\u000adoes not contain the information needed by the operation.

VAccording to Kim, Peris and Song, a continuous linear operator $T$ on a\u000acomplex Banach space $X$ is called {\u005cit numerically hypercyclic} if the\u000anumerical orbit $\u005c{f(T^nx):n\u005cin\u005cN\u005c}$ is dense in $\u005cC$ for some $x\u005cin X$ and\u000a$f\u005cin X^*$ satisfying $\u005c|x\u005c|=\u005c|f\u005c|=f(x)=1$. They have characterized numerically\u000ahypercyclic weighted shifts and provided an example of a numerically\u000ahypercyclic operator on $\u005cC^2$.\u000a  We answer two questions of Kim, Peris and Song. Namely, we construct a\u000anumerically hypercyclic operator, whose square is not numerically hypercyclic\u000aas well as an operator which is not numerically hypercyclic but has two\u000anumerical orbits whose union is dense in $\u005cC$. We characterize numerically\u000ahypercyclic operators on $\u005cC^2$ as well as the operators similar to a\u000anumerically hypercyclic one and those operators whose conjugacy class consists\u000aentirely of numerically hypercyclic operators. We describe in spectral terms\u000athe operator norm closure of the set of numerically hypercyclic operators on a\u000areflexive Banach space. Finally, we provide criteria for numeric hypercyclicity\u000aand decide upon the numerical hypercyclicity of operators from various classes.

VComparing Fifty Natural Languages and Twelve Genetic Languages Using\u000a  Word Embedding Language Divergence (WELD) as a Quantitative Measure of\u000a  Language Distance

VWe introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word\u000aembedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as\u000adivergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.\u000aUsing such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural\u000alanguages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a\u000acollection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for\u000afifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use\u000aparallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,\u000ainterestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.\u000aIn addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding\u000aregions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two\u000ahuman subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the\u000agenetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is\u000aa step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,\u000awith applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect\u000aidentification, and evaluation of translations.

VThere is considerable and growing interest in the emergence of novel\u000atechnologies, especially from the policy-making perspective. Yet as an area of\u000astudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\u000aconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\u000adesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\u000aaims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\u000alinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\u000aoperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\u000acombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\u000a'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\u000aissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\u000aattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\u000aradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\u000aimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\u000aemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\u000aattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\u000ain, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\u000astudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\u000acitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\u000aand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\u000aattributes of emergence.

The research has been developed under the SocRob project, carried\u000aout by the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the Institute for Systems and\u000aRobotics - Instituto Superior Tecnico (ISR/IST) in Lisbon. The acronym of the\u000aproject stands both for "Society of Robots" and "Soccer Robots", the case study\u000awhere we are testing our population of robots. Designing soccer robots is a\u000avery challenging problem, where the robots must act not only to shoot a ball\u000atowards the goal, but also to detect and avoid static (walls, stopped robots)\u000aand dynamic (moving robots) obstacles. Furthermore, they must cooperate to\u000adefeat an opposing team. Our past and current research in soccer robotics\u000aincludes cooperative sensor fusion for world modeling, object recognition and\u000atracking, robot navigation, multi-robot distributed task planning and\u000acoordination, including cooperative reinforcement learning in cooperative and\u000aadversarial environments, and behavior-based architectures for real time task\u000aexecution of cooperating robot teams.

p3848
sg7
VThe advent of artificial intelligence has changed many disciplines such as\u000aengineering, social science and economics. Artificial intelligence is a\u000acomputational technique which is inspired by natural intelligence such as the\u000aswarming of birds, the working of the brain and the pathfinding of the ants.\u000aThese techniques have impact on economic theories. This book studies the impact\u000aof artificial intelligence on economic theories, a subject that has not been\u000aextensively studied. The theories that are considered are: demand and supply,\u000aasymmetrical information, pricing, rational choice, rational expectation, game\u000atheory, efficient market hypotheses, mechanism design, prospect, bounded\u000arationality, portfolio theory, rational counterfactual and causality. The\u000abenefit of this book is that it evaluates existing theories of economics and\u000aupdate them based on the developments in artificial intelligence field.

VEvidential Force Aggregation
p3853
sg7
VIn this paper we develop an evidential force aggregation method intended for\u000aclassification of evidential intelligence into recognized force structures. We\u000aassume that the intelligence has already been partitioned into clusters and use\u000athe classification method individually in each cluster. The classification is\u000abased on a measure of fitness between template and fused intelligence that\u000amakes it possible to handle intelligence reports with multiple nonspecific and\u000auncertain propositions. With this measure we can aggregate on a level-by-level\u000abasis, starting from general intelligence to achieve a complete force structure\u000awith recognized units on all hierarchical levels.

VDispersion and Line Formation in Artificial Swarm Intelligence
p3863
sg7
VOne of the major motifs in collective or swarm intelligence is that, even\u000athough individuals follow simple rules, the resulting global behavior can be\u000acomplex and intelligent. In artificial swarm systems, such as swarm robots, the\u000agoal is to use systems that are as simple and cheap as possible, deploy many of\u000athem, and coordinate them to conduct complex tasks that each individual cannot\u000aaccomplish. Shape formation in artificial intelligence systems is usually\u000arequired for specific task-oriented performance, including 1) forming sensing\u000agrids, 2) exploring and mapping in space, underwater, or hazardous\u000aenvironments, and 3) forming a barricade for surveillance or protecting an area\u000aor a person. This paper presents a dynamic model of an artificial swarm system\u000abased on a virtual spring damper model and algorithms for dispersion without a\u000aleader and line formation with an interim leader using only the distance\u000aestimation among the neighbors.

VThis paper deals with the problem of classifying signals. The new method for\u000abuilding so called local classifiers and local features is presented. The\u000amethod is a combination of the lifting scheme and the support vector machines.\u000aIts main aim is to produce effective and yet comprehensible classifiers that\u000awould help in understanding processes hidden behind classified signals. To\u000aillustrate the method we present the results obtained on an artificial and a\u000areal dataset.

VEnergetics of the brain and AI
p3878
sg7
VDoes the energy requirements for the human brain give energy constraints that\u000agive reason to doubt the feasibility of artificial intelligence? This report\u000awill review some relevant estimates of brain bioenergetics and analyze some of\u000athe methods of estimating brain emulation energy requirements. Turning to AI,\u000athere are reasons to believe the energy requirements for de novo AI to have\u000alittle correlation with brain (emulation) energy requirements since cost could\u000adepend merely of the cost of processing higher-level representations rather\u000athan billions of neural firings. Unless one thinks the human way of thinking is\u000athe most optimal or most easily implementable way of achieving software\u000aintelligence, we should expect de novo AI to make use of different, potentially\u000avery compressed and fast, processes.

VVerified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-based\u000asystems that are provably correct with respect to mathematically-specified\u000arequirements. This paper considers Verified AI from a formal methods\u000aperspective. We describe five challenges for achieving Verified AI, and five\u000acorresponding principles for addressing these challenges.

VWe present an approach to the solution of decision problems formulated as\u000ainfluence diagrams. This approach involves a special triangulation of the\u000aunderlying graph, the construction of a junction tree with special properties,\u000aand a message passing algorithm operating on the junction tree for computation\u000aof expected utilities and optimal decision policies.

VApproximate Counting of Graphical Models Via MCMC Revisited
p3893
sg7
VIn Pe\u005c~na (2007), MCMC sampling is applied to approximately calculate the\u000aratio of essential graphs (EGs) to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for up to 20\u000anodes. In the present paper, we extend that work from 20 to 31 nodes. We also\u000aextend that work by computing the approximate ratio of connected EGs to\u000aconnected DAGs, of connected EGs to EGs, and of connected DAGs to DAGs.\u000aFurthermore, we prove that the latter ratio is asymptotically 1. We also\u000adiscuss the implications of these results for learning DAGs from data.

VArtificial Decision Making Under Uncertainty in Intelligent Buildings
p3898
sg7
VOur hypothesis is that by equipping certain agents in a multi-agent system\u000acontrolling an intelligent building with automated decision support, two\u000aimportant factors will be increased. The first is energy saving in the\u000abuilding. The second is customer value---how the people in the building\u000aexperience the effects of the actions of the agents. We give evidence for the\u000atruth of this hypothesis through experimental findings related to tools for\u000aartificial decision making. A number of assumptions related to agent control,\u000athrough monitoring and delegation of tasks to other kinds of agents, of rooms\u000aat a test site are relaxed. Each assumption controls at least one uncertainty\u000athat complicates considerably the procedures for selecting actions part of each\u000asuch agent. We show that in realistic decision situations, room-controlling\u000aagents can make bounded rational decisions even under dynamic real-time\u000aconstraints. This result can be, and has been, generalized to other domains\u000awith even harsher time constraints.

VFrame matroids and lifted-graphic matroids are two interesting\u000ageneralizations of graphic matroids. Here we introduce a new generalization,\u000a{\u005cem quasi-graphic matroids}, that unifies these two existing classes. Unlike\u000aframe matroids and lifted-graphic matroids, it is easy to certify that a\u000amatroid is quasi-graphic. The main result of the paper is that every\u000a$3$-connected representable quasi-graphic matroid is either a lifted-graphic\u000amatroid or a frame matroid.
