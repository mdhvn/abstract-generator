VThe Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) has evolved into a powerful and flexible\u000aprocessor. The latest graphic processors provide fully programmable vertex and\u000apixel processing units that support vector operations up to single\u000afloating-point precision. This computational power is now being used for\u000ageneral-purpose computations. However, some applications require higher\u000aprecision than single precision. This paper describes the emulation of a 44-bit\u000afloating-point number format and its corresponding operations. An\u000aimplementation is presented along with performance and accuracy results.

VSome Operators Associated to Rarita-Schwinger Type Operators
p22
sS'summary'
p23
VIn this paper we study some operators associated to the Rarita-Schwinger\u000aoperators. They arise from the difference between the Dirac operator and the\u000aRarita-Schwinger operators. These operators are called remaining operators.\u000aThey are based on the Dirac operator and projection operators $I-P_k.$ The\u000afundamental solutions of these operators are harmonic polynomials, homogeneous\u000aof degree $k$. First we study the remaining operators and their representation\u000atheory in Euclidean space. Second, we can extend the remaining operators in\u000aEuclidean space to the sphere under the Cayley transformation.

VThis paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic\u000aprograms into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an\u000aordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among\u000arules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is\u000atransformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the\u000apreferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed\u000atheory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since\u000athe result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic\u000aprogramming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular,\u000aPLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and\u000asmodels.

It extends\u000aLTL with operators of common and distributed knowledge for all coalitions of\u000aagents. The tableau procedure runs in exponential time, matching the lower\u000abound obtained by Halpern and Vardi for a fragment of our logic, thus providing\u000aa complexity-optimal decision procedure for CMATEL(CD+LT).

VWe demonstrate how multiagent systems provide useful control techniques for\u000amodular self-reconfigurable (metamorphic) robots. Such robots consist of many\u000amodules that can move relative to each other, thereby changing the overall\u000ashape of the robot to suit different tasks. Multiagent control is particularly\u000awell-suited for tasks involving uncertain and changing environments.

VThe paper presents two equivalent definitions of answer sets for logic\u000aprograms with aggregates. These definitions build on the notion of unfolding of\u000aaggregates, and they are aimed at creating methodologies to translate logic\u000aprograms with aggregates to normal logic programs or positive programs, whose\u000aanswer set semantics can be used to defined the semantics of the original\u000aprograms. The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics\u000afor logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.\u000a  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for\u000anormal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an\u000ainterpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper\u000ashows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of\u000athe rules.\u000a  The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and\u000acoincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic\u000acharacterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone\u000aaggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).\u000a  Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using\u000aavailable answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that\u000ais capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g.,\u000arecursively defined) aggregates.

VControl of Networked Multiagent Systems with Uncertain Graph Topologies
p54
sg39
VMultiagent systems consist of agents that locally exchange information\u000athrough a physical network subject to a graph topology. Current control methods\u000afor networked multiagent systems assume the knowledge of graph topologies in\u000aorder to design distributed control laws for achieving desired global system\u000abehaviors. However, this assumption may not be valid for situations where graph\u000atopologies are subject to uncertainties either due to changes in the physical\u000anetwork or the presence of modeling errors especially for multiagent systems\u000ainvolving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this\u000astandpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent\u000asystems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a\u000acontroller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in\u000aresponse to system variations. Specifically, we analytically show that the\u000aproposed controller drives the trajectories of a networked multiagent system\u000asubject to a graph topology with time-varying uncertainties to a close\u000aneighborhood of the trajectories of a given reference model having a desired\u000agraph topology. As a special case, we also show that a networked multi-agent\u000asystem subject to a graph topology with constant uncertainties asymptotically\u000aconverges to the trajectories of a given reference model. Although the main\u000aresult of this paper is presented in the context of average consensus problem,\u000athe proposed framework can be used for many other problems related to networked\u000amultiagent systems with uncertain graph topologies.

VTwo broad classes of graphical modeling problems for codes can be identified\u000ain the literature: constructive and extractive problems. The former class of\u000aproblems concern the construction of a graphical model in order to define a new\u000acode. The latter class of problems concern the extraction of a graphical model\u000afor a (fixed) given code. The design of a new low-density parity-check code for\u000asome given criteria (e.g. target block length and code rate) is an example of a\u000aconstructive problem. The determination of a graphical model for a classical\u000alinear block code which implies a decoding algorithm with desired performance\u000aand complexity characteristics is an example of an extractive problem. This\u000awork focuses on extractive graphical model problems and aims to lay out some of\u000athe foundations of the theory of such problems for linear codes.\u000a  The primary focus of this work is a study of the space of all graphical\u000amodels for a (fixed) given code. The tradeoff between cyclic topology and\u000acomplexity in this space is characterized via the introduction of a new bound:\u000athe tree-inducing cut-set bound. The proposed bound provides a more precise\u000acharacterization of this tradeoff than that which can be obtained using\u000aexisting tools (e.g. the Cut-Set Bound) and can be viewed as a generalization\u000aof the square-root bound for tail-biting trellises to graphical models with\u000aarbitrary cyclic topologies. Searching the space of graphical models for a\u000agiven code is then enabled by introducing a set of basic graphical model\u000atransformation operations which are shown to span this space. Finally,\u000aheuristics for extracting novel graphical models for linear block codes using\u000athese transformations are investigated.

VUser authentication is one of the most important part of information\u000asecurity. Computer security most commonly depends on passwords to authenticate\u000ahuman users. Password authentication systems will be either been usable but not\u000asecure, or secure but not usable. While there are different types of\u000aauthentication systems available alphanumeric password is the most commonly\u000aused authentication mechanism. But this method has significant drawbacks. An\u000aalternative solution to the text based authentication is Graphical User\u000aAuthentication based on the fact that humans tends to remember images better\u000athan text. Graphical password authentication systems provide passwords which\u000aare easy to be created and remembered by the user. However, the main issues of\u000asimple graphical password techniques are shoulder surfing attack and image\u000agallery attack. Studies reveals that most of the graphical passwords are either\u000asecure but not usable or usable but not secure. In this paper, a new technique\u000athat uses cued click point graphical password method along with the one-time\u000asession key is proposed. The goal is to propose a new authentication mechanism\u000ausing graphical password to achieve higher security and better usability\u000alevels. The result of the system testing is evaluated and it reveals that the\u000aproposed system ensures security and usability to a great extent.

We also approach FCA from\u000athe perspective of collections of formal contexts. Usually, when doing FCA, a\u000aformal context is fixed.

VSeparation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an\u000aimportant step of any optical character recognition sytem for the images\u000acontaing both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel\u000atext/graphics separation technique for business card images captured with a\u000acell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level\u000abased on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from\u000aeach other. Then the non-text components are removed using various\u000acharacteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are\u000askew corrected and binarized for further processing. Experimenting with\u000abusiness card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum\u000aperformance of 98.54% with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing\u000atime and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73\u000aGHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache).

These problems arise naturally in the current topic of\u000agraph modeling for complex networks. From the technical point of view, the\u000ajoint-degree matrix realization algorithm is straightforward. However, the\u000aconnected joint-degree matrix realization algorithm involves a novel recursive\u000asearch of suitable local graph modifications. Also, we outline directions for\u000afurther work of both theoretical and practical interest. In particular, we give\u000aa Markov chain which converges to the uniform distribution over all\u000arealizations. We show that the underline state space is connected, and we leave\u000athe question of the mixing rate open.

VThe problem of Natural Language Query Formalization (NLQF) is to translate a\u000agiven user query in natural language (NL) into a formal language so that the\u000asemantic interpretation has equivalence with the NL interpretation.\u000aFormalization of NL queries enables logic based reasoning during information\u000aretrieval, database query, question-answering, etc. Formalization also helps in\u000aWeb query normalization and indexing, query intent analysis, etc. In this paper\u000awe are proposing a Description Logics based formal methodology for wh-query\u000aintent (also called desire) identification and corresponding formal\u000atranslation. We evaluated the scalability of our proposed formalism using\u000aMicrosoft Encarta 98 query dataset and OWL-S TC v.4.0 dataset.

VA general approach for Bayesian filtering of multi-object systems is studied,\u000awith particular emphasis on the model where each object generates observations\u000aindependently of other objects. The approach is based on variational calculus\u000aapplied to generating functionals, using the general version of Faa di Bruno's\u000aformula for Gateaux differentials.

VThe Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational\u000amodel which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to\u000athe Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability\u000alevel and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.\u000aHowever, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation\u000ausing real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this\u000acase. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers\u000awere equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown\u000athat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to\u000aComputable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a\u000acomputational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the\u000aconnections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by\u000ashowing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can\u000abe simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than\u000athose used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about\u000abounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as\u000aspace-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.

VMany complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\u000aconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\u000asuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\u000aagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\u000athey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\u000acan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\u000avalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\u000aframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\u000aestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\u000amathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\u000asuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\u000aand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\u000asampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\u000adynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\u000aof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\u000auniversal model for computation.

VIn this paper we reexamine the place and role of stable model semantics in\u000alogic programming and contrast it with a least Herbrand model approach to Horn\u000aprograms. We demonstrate that inherent features of stable model semantics\u000anaturally lead to a logic programming system that offers an interesting\u000aalternative to more traditional logic programming styles of Horn logic\u000aprogramming, stratified logic programming and logic programming with\u000awell-founded semantics. The proposed approach is based on the interpretation of\u000aprogram clauses as constraints. In this setting programs do not describe a\u000asingle intended model, but a family of stable models. These stable models\u000aencode solutions to the constraint satisfaction problem described by the\u000aprogram. Our approach imposes restrictions on the syntax of logic programs. In\u000aparticular, function symbols are eliminated from the language. We argue that\u000athe resulting logic programming system is well-attuned to problems in the class\u000aNP, has a well-defined domain of applications, and an emerging methodology of\u000aprogramming. We point out that what makes the whole approach viable is recent\u000aprogress in implementations of algorithms to compute stable models of\u000apropositional logic programs.

VQuantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing\u000apower over classical computer \u005ccite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum\u000aobject passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum\u000acomputer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed\u000aduality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may\u000aoffer additional computing power \u005ccite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer\u000ais a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer\u000aoffers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming\u000aout of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show\u000athat an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum\u000acomputer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.\u000aA $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical\u000acomputer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit\u000aquantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical\u000acomputer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing\u000aand quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which\u000aa quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These\u000atwo modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the\u000aunsorted database search problem is designed.

This paper proposes how the same can be achieved for structured\u000aprogramming and PURELY functional programming via the notion of LINEAR SCOPE.\u000aOne advantage of this proposal is that mainstream programmers can reap the\u000abenefits of purely functional programming like easily exploitable parallelism\u000awhile using familiar structured programming syntax and without knowing concepts\u000alike monads. A second advantage is that professional purely functional\u000aprogrammers can often avoid hard to read functional code by using structured\u000aprogramming syntax that is often easier to parse mentally.

VWe present a new approach for recognition of complex graphic symbols in\u000atechnical documents. Graphic symbol recognition is a well known challenge in\u000athe field of document image analysis and is at heart of most graphic\u000arecognition systems. Our method uses structural approach for symbol\u000arepresentation and statistical classifier for symbol recognition. In our system\u000awe represent symbols by their graph based signatures: a graphic symbol is\u000avectorized and is converted to an attributed relational graph, which is used\u000afor computing a feature vector for the symbol. This signature corresponds to\u000ageometry and topology of the symbol. We learn a Bayesian network to encode\u000ajoint probability distribution of symbol signatures and use it in a supervised\u000alearning scenario for graphic symbol recognition. We have evaluated our method\u000aon synthetically deformed and degraded images of pre-segmented 2D architectural\u000aand electronic symbols from GREC databases and have obtained encouraging\u000arecognition rates.

Conditional Gaussian graphical models\u000ageneralize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional\u000adistributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input\u000avariables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian\u000agraphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian\u000agraphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to\u000amemory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new\u000aoptimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over\u000atwo sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared\u000ato the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems\u000aunder memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage\u000awhile achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show\u000athat our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in\u000aa little over a day on a single machine.

VPositivity, Betweenness and Strictness of Operator Means
p333
sg23
VAn operator mean is a binary operation assigned to each pair of positive\u000aoperators satisfying monotonicity, continuity from above, the transformer\u000ainequality and the fixed-point property. It is well known that there are\u000aone-to-one correspondences between operator means, operator monotone functions\u000aand Borel measures. In this paper, we provide various characterizations for the\u000aconcepts of positivity, betweenness and strictness of operator means in terms\u000aof operator monotone functions, Borel measures and certain operator equations.

VLet $\u005cPsi(t,k)$ denote the set of pairs $(v,\u005clambda)$ for which there exists\u000aa graphical $t$-$(v,k,\u005clambda)$ design. Most results on graphical designs have\u000agone to show the finiteness of $\u005cPsi(t,k)$ when $t$ and $k$ satisfy certain\u000aconditions. The exact determination of $\u005cPsi(t,k)$ for specified $t$ and $k$ is\u000aa hard problem and only $\u005cPsi(2,3)$, $\u005cPsi(2,4)$, $\u005cPsi(3,4)$, $\u005cPsi(4,5)$, and\u000a$\u005cPsi(5,6)$ have been determined. In this paper, we determine completely the\u000asets $\u005cPsi(2,5)$ and $\u005cPsi(3,5)$. As a result, we find more than 270000\u000ainequivalent graphical designs, and more than 8000 new parameter sets for which\u000athere exists a graphical design. Prior to this, graphical designs are known for\u000aonly 574 parameter sets.

VThis paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning\u000afrom a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models\u000ainclude Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and\u000aundirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are\u000aextended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of\u000aplates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are\u000aprovided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of\u000aprobability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas\u000afor learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the\u000aexpectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some\u000apopular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This\u000aincludes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks,\u000aand learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper\u000aconcludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how\u000asome popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original\u000acontributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that\u000agraphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex\u000alearning algorithms.

VSeparation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an\u000aimportant step of any optical character recognition system for the images\u000acontaining both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel\u000atext/graphics separation technique and a method for skew correction of text\u000aregions extracted from business card images captured with a cell-phone camera.\u000aAt first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity\u000avariance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then\u000athe non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of\u000atext and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected for further\u000aprocessing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we\u000ahave found an optimum performance of 98.25% (recall) with 0.75 MP images, that\u000atakes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately\u000apowerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The\u000adeveloped technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as\u000ato be applicable on mobile devices.

The proposed\u000adecomposition differs from previous decomposition results on matroids that have\u000aappeared in the literature in the sense that it is not based on $k$-sums, but\u000arather on the operation of deletion of a cocircuit. Specifically, it is shown\u000athat certain minors resulting from the deletion of a cocircuit of a binary\u000amatroid will be graphic matroids apart from exactly one that will be\u000asigned-graphic, if and only if the matroid is signed-graphic.

VWe propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability\u000aas a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same\u000away as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL\u000amanifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2\u000atheory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts\u000aneeded to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible\u000acomputable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\u005cPhi$ defined on a\u000aset $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \u005ctau_\u005cPhi,\u000a\u005cbeta_\u005cPhi, \u005cnu_\u005cPhi)$, where $\u005ctau_\u005cPhi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by\u000a$\u005cPhi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes\u000athe computable structure determined by $\u005cPhi$. The concept of computable\u000asubmanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold\u000awhich satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be\u000aembedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\u005cmathbb{R}^{q}$,\u000awith a computable embedding, where $\u005cmathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual\u000atopology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.

VThere are a variety of existing conditions for a degree sequence to be\u000agraphic. When a degree sequence satisfies any of these conditions, there exists\u000aa graph that realizes the sequence. We formulate several novel sufficient\u000agraphicality criteria that depend on the number of elements in the sequence,\u000acorresponding to the number of nodes in an associated graph, and the mean\u000adegree of the sequence. These conditions, which are stated in terms of bidegree\u000asequences for directed graphs, are easier to apply than classic necessary and\u000asufficient graphicality conditions involving multiple inequalities. They are\u000aalso more flexible than more recent graphicality conditions, in that they imply\u000agraphicality of some degree sequences not covered by those conditions. The form\u000aof our results will allow them to be easily used for the generation of graphs\u000awith particular degree sequences for applications.

VGaussian graphical model is a graphical representation of the dependence\u000astructure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in\u000adifferent applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech\u000alanguage, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection\u000ais a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample\u000aof a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection\u000aare suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family\u000aof individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach\u000aleads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical\u000aprocedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic\u000aof these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing\u000aliterature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect\u000aedge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also\u000aimportant to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type\u000aII error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection\u000aproblem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of\u000astatistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses.\u000aAdditive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We\u000aconstruct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine\u000athem to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the\u000aobtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear\u000acombination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of\u000aunbiased multiple decision procedures.

VGraphical models are used to describe the conditional independence relations\u000ain multivariate data. They have been used for a variety of problems, including\u000alog-linear models (Liu and Massam, 2006), network analysis (Holland and\u000aLeinhardt, 1981; Strauss and Ikeda, 1990; Wasserman and Pattison, 1996;\u000aPattison and Wasserman, 1999; Robins et al., 1999);, graphical Gaussian models\u000a(Roverato and Whittaker, 1998; Giudici and Green, 1999; Marrelec and Benali,\u000a2006), and genetics (Dobra et al., 2004). A distribution that satisfies the\u000aconditional independence structure of a graph is Markov. A graphical model is a\u000afamily of distributions that is restricted to be Markov with respect to a\u000acertain graph. In a Bayesian problem, one may specify a prior over the\u000agraphical model. Such a prior is called a hyper Markov law if the random\u000amarginals also satisfy the independence constraints. Previous work in this area\u000aincludes (Dempster, 1972; Dawid and Lauritzen, 1993; Giudici and Green, 1999;\u000aLetac and Massam, 2007). We explore graphical models based on a non-parametric\u000afamily of distributions, developed from Dirichlet processes.

VWe need much better understanding of information processing and computation\u000aas its primary form. Future progress of new computational devices capable of\u000adealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive\u000arobotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In\u000athis article we first present the current state of the art through\u000asystematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural\u000aframework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information\u000aprocessing, and given that there is no information without (physical)\u000arepresentation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is\u000aphysical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic\u000acomputation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic\u000anatural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes,\u000acontaining the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly\u000aintelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present\u000aarticle offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future\u000apaths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new\u000acomputational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using\u000adifferent mechanisms of intrinsic computation.

VProbabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability\u000atheory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified\u000adescription of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical\u000amodel. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful\u000aproperties:\u000a  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the\u000astructures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to\u000adesign and motivate new models.\u000a  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the\u000amodel, including the conditional independence properties.\u000a  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning\u000ain sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations,\u000ain which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\u000a  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including\u000abioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing\u000aanalysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models\u000aremains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over\u000athe space of all possible structures.\u000a  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure\u000alearning algorithms.

VWe introduce block-tree graphs as a framework for deriving efficient\u000aalgorithms on graphical models. We define block-tree graphs as a\u000atree-structured graph where each node is a cluster of nodes such that the\u000aclusters in the graph are disjoint. This differs from junction-trees, where two\u000aclusters connected by an edge always have at least one common node. When\u000acompared to junction-trees, we show that constructing block-tree graphs is\u000afaster, and finding optimal block-tree graphs has a much smaller search space.\u000aApplying our block-tree graph framework to graphical models, we show that, for\u000asome graphs, e.g., grid graphs, using block-tree graphs for inference is\u000acomputationally more efficient than using junction-trees. For graphical models\u000awith boundary conditions, the block-tree graph framework transforms the\u000aboundary valued problem into an initial value problem. For Gaussian graphical\u000amodels, the block-tree graph framework leads to a linear state-space\u000arepresentation. Since exact inference in graphical models can be\u000acomputationally intractable, we propose to use spanning block-trees to derive\u000aapproximate inference algorithms. Experimental results show the improved\u000aperformance in using spanning block-trees versus using spanning trees for\u000aapproximate estimation over Gaussian graphical models.

VPotential games, originally introduced in the early 1990's by Lloyd Shapley,\u000athe 2012 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and his colleague Dov Monderer, are a\u000avery important class of models in game theory. They have special properties\u000asuch as the existence of Nash equilibria in pure strategies. This note\u000aintroduces graphical versions of potential games. Special cases of graphical\u000apotential games have already found applicability in many areas of science and\u000aengineering beyond economics, including artificial intelligence, computer\u000avision, and machine learning. They have been effectively applied to the study\u000aand solution of important real-world problems such as routing and congestion in\u000anetworks, distributed resource allocation (e.g., public goods), and\u000arelaxation-labeling for image segmentation. Implicit use of graphical potential\u000agames goes back at least 40 years. Several classes of games considered standard\u000ain the literature, including coordination games, local interaction games,\u000alattice games, congestion games, and party-affiliation games, are instances of\u000agraphical potential games. This note provides several characterizations of\u000agraphical potential games by leveraging well-known results from the literature\u000aon probabilistic graphical models. A major contribution of the work presented\u000ahere that particularly distinguishes it from previous work is establishing that\u000athe convergence of certain type of game-playing rules implies that the\u000aagents/players must be embedded in some graphical potential game.

VGraphical model has been widely used to investigate the complex dependence\u000astructure of high-dimensional data, and it is common to assume that observed\u000adata follow a homogeneous graphical model. However, observations usually come\u000afrom different resources and have heterogeneous hidden commonality in\u000areal-world applications. Thus, it is of great importance to estimate\u000aheterogeneous dependencies and discover subpopulation with certain commonality\u000aacross the whole population. In this work, we introduce a novel regularized\u000aestimation scheme for learning nonparametric mixture of Gaussian graphical\u000amodels, which extends the methodology and applicability of Gaussian graphical\u000amodels and mixture models. We propose a unified penalized likelihood approach\u000ato effectively estimate nonparametric functional parameters and heterogeneous\u000agraphical parameters. We further design an efficient generalized effective EM\u000aalgorithm to address three significant challenges: high-dimensionality,\u000anon-convexity, and label switching. Theoretically, we study both the\u000aalgorithmic convergence of our proposed algorithm and the asymptotic properties\u000aof our proposed estimators. Numerically, we demonstrate the performance of our\u000amethod in simulation studies and a real application to estimate human brain\u000afunctional connectivity from ADHD imaging data, where two heterogeneous\u000aconditional dependencies are explained through profiling demographic variables\u000aand supported by existing scientific findings.

We used the Sage\u000aMathematics software to generate many examples of signed-graphic matroids and\u000atheir signed-graphic representations. Our examples show that column scaling is\u000asometimes necessary in order to transform one signed-graphic representation\u000ainto another; moreover, there exist many collections of signed-graphic\u000arepresentations that row-reduce to the same standard form.

VThe main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of a computer\u000ascreen interface design and its related geometrical characteristics of 36\u000agraphical objects on a user's task efficiency. A total of 490 subjects took\u000apart in laboratory experiments that focused on the direct manipulation of a\u000avisual dialogue between a user and a computer. The subjects were asked to\u000aselect an object from among a group of items randomly placed on the computer\u000ascreen that were visible exclusively during the visual search process. A model\u000aexpressing the mean object acquisition time as a function of graphical object\u000asize and the configuration was developed and statistically validated. The model\u000ashowed an influence of geometrical design characteristics of the graphical\u000aobjects (icons) and their groupings (icon structures) on the observed task\u000aefficiency. The reported results can be used at those stages of a software\u000alifecycle that concentrate on prototyping, designing, and implementing\u000agraphical solutions for the efficient graphical user-computer interface.

VProgram understanding is an important aspect in Software Maintenance and\u000aReengineering. Understanding the program is related to execution behaviour and\u000arelationship of variable involved in the program. The task of finding all\u000astatements in a program that directly or indirectly influence the value for an\u000aoccurrence of a variable gives the set of statements that can affect the value\u000aof a variable at some point in a program is called a program slice. Program\u000aslicing is a technique for extracting parts of computer programs by tracing the\u000aprograms' control and data flow related to some data item. This technique is\u000aapplicable in various areas such as debugging, program comprehension and\u000aunderstanding, program integration, cohesion measurement, re-engineering,\u000amaintenance, testing where it is useful to be able to focus on relevant parts\u000aof large programs. This paper focuses on the various slicing techniques (not\u000alimited to) like static slicing, quasi static slicing, dynamic slicing and\u000aconditional slicing. This paper also includes various methods in performing the\u000aslicing like forward slicing, backward slicing, syntactic slicing and semantic\u000aslicing. The slicing of a program is carried out using Java which is a object\u000aoriented programming language.

VBicircular lift matroids are a class of matroids defined on the edge set of a\u000agraph. For a given graph $G$, the circuits of its bicircular lift matroid\u000a$L(G)$ are the edge sets of those subgraphs of $G$ that contain at least two\u000acycles, and are minimal with respect to this property. For each cycle $C$ of\u000a$G$, since $L(G)/C$ is graphic and most graphic matroids are not bicircular\u000alift, the class of bicircular lift matroids is not minor-closed. In this paper,\u000awe prove that the class of matroids that are graphic or bicircular lift has a\u000afinite list of excluded minors.

VThe formalisms of Wyld [2] and Martin, Siggia, and Rose (MSR) [3] address the\u000aclosure problem of a statistical treatment of homogeneous isotropic turbulence\u000a(HIT) based on techniques primarily developed for quantum field theory. In the\u000aWyld formalism, there is a well-known double-counting problem, for which an\u000a{\u005cit ad hoc} solution was suggested by Lee [44]. We show how to implement this\u000acorrection in a more natural way from the basic equations of the formalism.\u000aThis leads to what we call the "Improved Wyld-Lee Renormalized Perturbation\u000aTheory". MSR had noted that their formalism had more vertex functions than\u000aWyld's formalism and based on this felt Wyld's formalism was incorrect. However\u000aa careful comparison of both formalisms here shows that the Wyld formalism\u000afollows a different procedure to that of the MSR formalism and so the treatment\u000aof vertex corrections appears in different ways in the two formalisms. Taking\u000athat into account, along with clarifications made to both formalisms, we find\u000athat they are equivalent and we demonstrate this up to fourth order.

VInspired by the recently introduced framework of AND/OR search spaces for\u000agraphical models, we propose to augment Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDD)\u000awith AND nodes, in order to capture function decomposition structure and to\u000aextend these compiled data structures to general weighted graphical models\u000a(e.g., probabilistic models). We present the AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision\u000aDiagram (AOMDD) which compiles a graphical model into a canonical form that\u000asupports polynomial (e.g., solution counting, belief updating) or constant time\u000a(e.g. equivalence of graphical models) queries. We provide two algorithms for\u000acompiling the AOMDD of a graphical model. The first is search-based, and works\u000aby applying reduction rules to the trace of the memory intensive AND/OR search\u000aalgorithm. The second is inference-based and uses a Bucket Elimination schedule\u000ato combine the AOMDDs of the input functions via the the APPLY operator. For\u000aboth algorithms, the compilation time and the size of the AOMDD are, in the\u000aworst case, exponential in the treewidth of the graphical model, rather than\u000apathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). We\u000aintroduce the concept of semantic treewidth, which helps explain why the size\u000aof a decision diagram is often much smaller than the worst case bound. We\u000aprovide an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the potential of AOMDDs.

VIn this paper we consider the problem of learning undirected graphical models\u000afrom data generated according to the Glauber dynamics. The Glauber dynamics is\u000aa Markov chain that sequentially updates individual nodes (variables) in a\u000agraphical model and it is frequently used to sample from the stationary\u000adistribution (to which it converges given sufficient time). Additionally, the\u000aGlauber dynamics is a natural dynamical model in a variety of settings. This\u000awork deviates from the standard formulation of graphical model learning in the\u000aliterature, where one assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution.\u000a  Much of the research on graphical model learning has been directed towards\u000afinding algorithms with low computational cost. As the main result of this\u000awork, we establish that the problem of reconstructing binary pairwise graphical\u000amodels is computationally tractable when we observe the Glauber dynamics.\u000aSpecifically, we show that a binary pairwise graphical model on $p$ nodes with\u000amaximum degree $d$ can be learned in time $f(d)p^2\u005clog p$, for a function\u000a$f(d)$, using nearly the information-theoretic minimum number of samples.

VThe concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is\u000acentral to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and\u000ainteractive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical\u000adevices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise\u000adifficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This\u000apaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\u000atheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\u000ainformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\u000aentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\u000astructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\u000aprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\u000aphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\u000aprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\u000atheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\u000athese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\u000astructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\u000aimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\u000aimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\u000afor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\u000aand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\u000ainformation graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image\u000aschemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory\u000aof design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new\u000ainformation visualization techniques.

VQuantifications of strictly singular operators and strictly cosingular\u000a  operators
p623
sg23
VWe investigate possible quantifications of strictly singular operators,\u000a$l_{p}$-strictly singular operators, $c_{0}$-strictly singular operators,\u000astrictly cosingular operators, $l_{p}$-strictly cosingular operators. We prove\u000aquantitative, even strengthening versions of well-known results about\u000arelationships of these five classes of operators and compact, weakly compact,\u000aunconditionally converging operators.

VWe discuss a topic on the role of computer graphics in the production of\u000adocumentaries, which is often ignored in favor of other topics. Typically,\u000aexcept for some rare occasions, documentary producers and computer scientists\u000aor digital artists that do computer graphics are relatively far apart in their\u000adomains and rarely intercommunicate to have a joint production; yet it happens,\u000aand perhaps more so in the present and the future.\u000a  We attempt to classify the documentaries on the amount and techniques of\u000acomputer graphics used for documentaries. We come up with the initial\u000acategories such as "plain" (no graphics), "in-between", "all-out" -- nearly\u000a100% of the documentary consisting of computer-generated imagery. Computer\u000agraphics can be used to enhance the scenery, fill in the gaps in the missing\u000astoryline pieces, or animate between scenes. It can incorporate stereoscopic\u000aeffects for higher viewer impression as well as interactivity aspects. It can\u000aalso be used simply in old archived image and film restoration.

VWe consider the problem of estimating multiple related but distinct graphical\u000amodels on the basis of a high-dimensional data set with observations that\u000abelong to distinct classes. A motivating example occurs in the analysis of gene\u000aexpression data for tissue samples with and without cancer. In this case, we\u000amight wish to estimate a gene expression network for the normal tissue and a\u000agene expression network for the tumor tissue. We expect the two gene expression\u000anetworks to be similar but not identical to each other, and so more accurate\u000aestimation of these two networks may be possible using a joint approach. We\u000apropose the joint graphical lasso for this purpose. Rather than estimating a\u000agraphical model for each class separately, or a single graphical model across\u000aall classes, we borrow strength across the classes in order to estimate\u000amultiple graphical models that share certain characteristics, such as the\u000alocations or weights of nonzero edges. Our approach is based upon maximizing a\u000apenalized log likelihood. We employ fused lasso or group lasso penalties, and\u000aimplement a very fast computational approach that solves the joint graphical\u000alasso problem. In a simulation study we demonstrate that our proposed approach\u000aleads to more accurate estimation of networks and covariance structure than\u000acompeting approaches. We further illustrate our proposal on a\u000apublicly-available lung cancer gene expression data set.

VSeveral matroids can be defined on the edge set of a graph. Although\u000ahistorically the cycle matroid has been the most studied, in recent times, the\u000abicircular matroid has cropped up in several places. A theorem of Matthews from\u000alate 1970s gives a characterization of graphs whose bicircular matroids are\u000agraphic. We give a characterization of graphs whose bicircular matroids are\u000asigned-graphic.

VThis text provides with an introduction to the modern approach of\u000aartificiality and simulation in social sciences. It presents the relationship\u000abetween complexity and artificiality, before introducing the field of\u000aartificial societies which greatly benefited from the computer power fast\u000aincrease, gifting social sciences with formalization and experimentation tools\u000apreviously owned by "hard" sciences alone. It shows that as "a new way of doing\u000asocial sciences", artificial societies should undoubtedly contribute to a\u000arenewed approach in the study of sociality and should play a significant part\u000ain the elaboration of original theories of social phenomena.

VTeaching object-oriented programming in an introductory programming course\u000aposes considerable challenges to the instructor. An often advocated approach to\u000ameeting this challenge is the use of a simple, object-oriented graphics\u000alibrary. We have developed a simple, portable graphics library for teaching\u000aobject-oriented programming using C++. The library, EzWindows, allows beginning\u000aprogrammers to design and write programs that use the graphical display found\u000aon all modern desktop computers. In addition to providing simple graphical\u000aobjects such as windows, geometric shapes, and bitmaps, EzWindows provides\u000afacilities for introducing event-based programming using the mouse and timers.\u000aEzWindows has proven to be extremely popular; it is currently in use at over\u000a200 universities, colleges, and high schools. This paper describes the\u000arationale for EzWindows and its high-level design.

VWe present an approach to program reasoning which inserts between a program\u000aand its verification conditions an additional layer, the denotation of the\u000aprogram expressed in a declarative form. The program is first translated into\u000aits denotation from which subsequently the verification conditions are\u000agenerated. However, even before (and independently of) any verification\u000aattempt, one may investigate the denotation itself to get insight into the\u000a"semantic essence" of the program, in particular to see whether the denotation\u000aindeed gives reason to believe that the program has the expected behavior.\u000aErrors in the program and in the meta-information may thus be detected and\u000afixed prior to actually performing the formal verification. More concretely,\u000afollowing the relational approach to program semantics, we model the effect of\u000aa program as a binary relation on program states. A formal calculus is devised\u000ato derive from a program a logic formula that describes this relation and is\u000asubject for inspection and manipulation. We have implemented this idea in a\u000acomprehensive form in the RISC ProgramExplorer, a new program reasoning\u000aenvironment for educational purposes which encompasses the previously developed\u000aRISC ProofNavigator as an interactive proving assistant.
