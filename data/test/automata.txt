Priced timed automata provide a natural model for quantitative analysis of real-time systems and
have been successfully applied in various scheduling and planning problems. The optimal reachability problem for linearly-priced timed automata is known to be PSPACE-complete. In this paper
we investigate priced timed automata with more general prices and show that in the most general
setting the optimal reachability problem is undecidable. We adapt and implement the construction of
Audemard, Cimatti, Kornilowicz, and Sebastiani for non-linear priced timed automata using stateof-the-art theorem prover Z3 and present some preliminary results.

Introduction

Timed automata, introduced by Alur and Dill [3], extend finite state automata with continuous variables—
referred as clocks—that evolve with uniform rates. Time automata syntax permits comparing clocks
with integers as guard on transitions and as well as invariants on locations (states), and also allows clock
resets as a way to remember the time a transition was last fired. These features of time automata are general enough to permit modeling rich timing properties of real-time systems while providing a decidable
verification framework. Timed automata have been quite successful in practice due to their appealing
theoretical properties as well as the presence of mature verification tools such as UPPAAL.
Priced timed automata [9, 8] are extensions of timed automata which permit us to model cost associated with staying at locations as well as taking discrete transitions. Priced timed automata are useful in
modeling various decision-theoretic problem in the presence of strict timing constraints. The most natural problem studied on these models is the optimal reachability problem (shortest path problem) where
the goal is to find the minimum (or maximum) cost to reach a given set of locations.
Linearly-priced timed automata [6] (LPTA), also known as weighted timed automata, are subclasses
of priced timed automata where prices change linearly with respect to delay incurred at particular location. For LPTA the optimal reachability problem is known to be decidable and is shown to be PSPACEcomplete exploiting a clever extension of region graphs to so-called corner-point abstraction by Bouyer
et al. [8]. Alur et al. [4] earlier gave an EXPTIME algorithm to solve the problem with an arbitrary initial
state by giving a non-trivial extension of the region graph. Larsen et al. [6, 9] gave a symbolic algorithm
to solve the problem, although with some restrictions on the initial state (a corner state with all clocks
set to zero). A recent result by Fearnley and Jurdzinksi [13] showed that the PSPACE-hardness results
hold for timed automata with two clocks [13]. On the other hand, for timed automata with one clock,
reachability-time and reachability-price problems are known to be NL-complete [19].
In practice, however, the requirement for nonlinear pricing models is quite common. As an example
consider the optimal scheduling problem of battery usage in embedded systems studied by Jongerden et

al. [16]. In this work authors modeled batteries using kinetic battery model (KiBaM). KiBaM itself is a
nonlinear model, but Jongerden et al. [16] manually discretized it to required approximation to model the
whole problem as optimization on LPTA. Similar scenarios can be cited from other application domains
of priced timed automata such as scheduling [7], resource modeling and analysis [14], and optimal
synthesis [15]. However, we believe that providing non-linear price modeling facilities directly in the
language of timed automata will further their applicability in system design. Jurdzinski and Trivedi [18]
introduced a non-linear subclass of priced timed automata, so-called concavely-priced timed automata,
where prices in each location are certain concave prices of valuation and time delays. Exploiting the
concave nature of the prices, they showed that the optimal price reachability problem for this class
of automata has the same complexity as that of LPTA. Priced timed automata with exponential price
functions were studied in a restricted context by Bouyer et al. [10] and Fahrenberg and Larsen [12].
In this paper we uniformly study various subclasses of (non-linear) priced timed automata, and study
the boundary between decidable and undecidable variants of PTA. Towards this goal we first show the
undecidability of the optimal reachability problem for unrestricted priced timed automata by showing
a reduction from the halting problem for two-counter machines. For reasoning with decidable variants,
we first introduce a key notion of price-preserving bisimilarity. We exploit this notion to formalize
reduction for the optimal cost reachability problem for piecewise-linear priced timed automata to linearly
priced timed automata. We also show the decidability of ε -optimal cost reachability for priced timed
automata with Lipschitz-continuous prices. Finally, we adapt the construction of Audemard, Cimatti,
Kornilowicz, and Sebastiani [5] for bounded model-checking of timed automata using SAT solvers to
work for bounded reachability problem for non-linearly priced timed automata using SMT solver Z3 [11].
In conjunction with a decision procedure for the theory of the class of price functions (for instance
polynomial prices [17, 11]), our implementation can be used to compute bounded-step cost-optimal
schedules for priced timed automata. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using airplane
landing problem [7].
This paper is organized as follows: we begin by defining syntax and semantics of generalized priced
timed automata in the next section. We define various pricing models and their hierarchy. We prove key
undecidability result in Section 3 and show decidability results in Section 4. Finally, in section 5 we
present the details of our implementation and experimental results.

Priced Timed Automata

We denote sets of integers, rational numbers and real numbers as Z, Q and R respectively. Their respective non-negative subsets are denoted as Z+ , Q+ and R+ .
Let X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be the finite set of clocks. A clock valuation is a map ν : X 7→ R+ . Thus, a
given clock valuation ν maps clock xi to a value νi . This fact is written as ν (xi ) = νi . In n-tuple form,
a clock valuation ν is denoted as (ν1 , ν2 , . . . , νn ). Given a clock valuation ν and τ ∈ R+ , ν + τ is the
clock valuation defined by (ν1 + τ , ν2 + τ , . . . , νn + τ ). A guard is any finite conjunction of clauses of
the form xi ∼ c, where clock xi ∈ X , constant c ∈ Z+ and ∼ is one of the comparison operators in set
V
{<, ≤, =, >, ≥}. Let G be the set of guards. Given a valuation ν and a guard g = j (xi ∼ c j ), ν  g
V
means expression j (ν (xi ) ∼ c j ) evaluates to true. For Y ⊆ X , ν [Y := 0] denotes clock valuation in
which clocks in Y are reset to 0 while other clocks remain unchanged.
Timed Automata. A timed transition system T is a tuple (L, X , E) where (i) L is a finite set of locations, (ii) X is a finite set of clocks variables, and (iii) E is set of transitions. A configuration of T

is a pair (ℓ, ν ), where ℓ ∈ L is a location and ν in clock valuation over set X . Let QT be the set of

Definition A timed automaton A is a tuple (L, X , E, I) where (i) L is a finite set of locations (ii) X is a
finite set of clocks (iii) E ⊆ L × G × 2X × L is a finite set of edges (iv) I : L 7→ G assigns an invariant to
each location.

A run ρ = q0 → q1 → · · · → qm of the timed automaton A is a finite path in the induced timed
transition system TA where every qi is configuration in TA and → is either delay or switch edge in EA .
We use notation ρ = q0
qm for a run from q0 to qm . We write Runs(q, q′ ) for the set of runs from the
′
location q to q . A run is said to be canonical if delay and switch transitions alternate.
Priced timed automata. A priced timed automaton (PTA) is a timed automaton A = (L, X , E, I, π , ψ )
augmented with a price functions π : QA × R+ 7→ R+ and ψ : E 7→ Z+ which assign prices (costs) for
waiting at locations and taking edges, where QA is the set of the configurations of timed automaton A .

A priced timed transition system T is a tuple (L, X , E) where (i) L is a set of locations (ii) X is a
finite set of clocks (iii) E is a set of transitions. A configuration is a tuple (ℓ, ν , u), where ℓ ∈ L is a
location, ν is a clock valuation over set X and u ∈ R is current accumulated price. Let QT be the set of

functions such clubbing may not yield valid transitions. Similarly, there cannot be consecutive switch
transitions without zero delay transition between them.

A run of the transition system TA starts with some configuration (ℓ, ν , u0 ) where ℓ ∈ L, ν ∈ (R+ )X and
u0 ∈ R. We do not explicitly specify initial configuration in our definition of priced timed automaton.
Cost-optimal reachability problem Let A be a priced timed automaton. Given two locations ℓ, ℓ′ of
A, the optimal cost OptCost(ℓ, ℓ′ ), of reaching ℓ′ from ℓ is defined as
OptCost(ℓ, ℓ′ ) =

inf

ρ ∈Runs(ℓ,ℓ′ )

C(ρ ).

Given priced timed automaton A , locations ℓ, ℓ′ , and a budget B ∈ R the cost-optimal reachability
problem is to decide whether OptCost(ℓ, ℓ′ ) ≤ B.
Summary of Our Results. Our first result (Section 3) is that the optimal cost reachability problem for
general priced timed automata is undecidable.
Theorem 2.1 Cost-optimal reachability problem for nonlinearly priced timed automata is undecidable.
Given this negative result it is justifiable to look for various restricted subclasses of price functions
in order to recover decidable variants. The first subclass that we consider is piece-wise linear price
functions. A piecewise linear price function f : R+ →R can be represented as tuple (Pℓ ,YPℓ ,YIℓ ) where
• Pℓ = hp1 = 0, p2 , . . . , pn i is an increasing sequence of n-points in time. First point p1 is always at
time value zero. Thus, p1 (= 0) < p2 < . . . < pn holds.
• YPℓ = hy p1 , y p2 , . . . , y pn i is a sequence of prices such that y pi = fℓ (pi ).
• YIℓ = h(m1 , c1 ), (m2 , c2 ), . . . , (mn , cn )i is a sequence of n tuples. Time intervals formed by points
def
def
in Pℓ are I1 = (p1 , p2 ), · · · , In = (pn , +∞). Again let I = hI1 , . . . , In i be the sequence of intervals.
Value of piecewise linear price function fℓ in the interval Ik is given by parameters in tuple (mk , ck ),
such that if τ ∈ Ik , f (τ ) = mk τ + ck .
We call tuple (Pℓ ,YPℓ ,YIℓ ) as structure of function f . We call a timed automaton is piecewise linearly
priced if for all configuration (ℓ, ν ) we have that π ((ℓ, ν ), τ ) = fℓ (τ ), where fℓ = (Pℓ ,YPℓ ,YIℓ ), is a piecewise linear function defined over interval [0, +∞) and all the constants appearing in its structure are
integers. Observe that the standard definition of linearly priced timed automata can be casted as a special
case of piecewise linearly priced timed automata such that fℓ = (Pℓ ,YPℓ ,YIℓ ), where Pℓ = h0i, YPℓ = h0i,
and YIℓ = h(kℓ , 0)i such that kℓ is rate of change of price at location ℓ. For LPTA the cost-optimal reachability problem is known to be PSPACE-complete [8]. In Section 4 we show the following key result of
piecewise linearly priced timed automata.
Theorem 2.2 The cost-optimal reachability problem for piecewise linearly priced timed automaton is
PSPACE-complete.
This result can easily be extended to piecewise-concave priced timed automata [18].
We also study more general Lipschitz continuously priced timed automata. We say that a function
f : R 7→ R is Lipschitz continuous function, if there exists a constant K ≥ 0, called Lipschitz constant
of f , s.t. k f (x) − f (y)k ≤ Kkx − yk for all x, y in the domain of f . A timed automaton is then called
Lipschitz continuous priced if price functions π ((ℓ, ν ), τ ) = fℓ (τ ), are Lipschitz continuous for every
location ℓ and there exists a constant T such that all the clock valuations are bounded from above by
T . For this class of functions the optimal reachability problem may not be computable due to optimal
occurring at non-rational points. For this reason we study the following approximate optimal problem.

ε -Cost-optimal reachability problem Let A be a priced timed automaton. Given ε > 0 and two locations ℓ, ℓ′ of A , a budget B ∈ R+ , the ε -optimal cost problem is to decide whether OptCost(ℓ, ℓ′ ) ≤ B + ε .

Undecidability

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.1. We prove this result by reducing the halting problem for two counter machines to the cost-optimal reachability problem for priced timed automata. A
two-counter machine M is a tuple (L,C) where L = {ℓ0 , ℓ1 , . . . , ℓn } is the set of instructions including
a distinguished terminal instruction ℓn called HALT, and the set C = {c1 , c2 } of two counters. The instructions L are of the type: (1) (increment c) ℓi : c := c + 1; goto ℓk , (2) (decrement c) ℓi : c := c − 1;
goto ℓk , (3) (zero-check c) ℓi : if (c > 0) then goto ℓk else goto ℓm , where c ∈ C, ℓi , ℓk , ℓm ∈ L. A configuration of a two-counter machine is a tuple (ℓ, c, d) where ℓ ∈ L is an instruction, and c, d ∈ N is the
value of counters c1 and c2 , resp. A run of a two-counter machine is a (finite or infinite) sequence of
configurations hk0 , k1 , . . .i where k0 = (ℓ0 , 0, 0) and the relation between subsequent configurations is
governed by transitions between respective instructions. The halting problem for a two-counter machine
asks whether its unique run ends at the terminal instruction ℓn . The halting problem for two-counter
machines is known [20] to be undecidable.
Proof of Theorem 2.1 We reduce the reachability problem of two counter machines to an instance of
the cost-optimal reachability problem OptCost(q, q′ ) for priced timed automata A such that desired
configuration of two counter machine is reachable from its initial configuration iff there is a run in the
automaton A from q to q′ of cost exactly zero.

Let M be the instance of the two counter machine having counters c and d. We construct a PTA A
from M using suitable encoding. Valid runs of M are mapped to valid runs of A such that their cost
is exactly zero. Figure 1 and 2 describes the module simulating counter decrement instruction of M .
PTA A is constructed by composing the various modules. A uses four clocks – x, y, w and z, out of
which x and y encode counters c and d as x = 1 − 21c and y = 1 − 21d . Let enc(·) denote this encoding
function. Testing whether c is zero amounts to testing x is zero in the guards of A . Figure 1 describes
decrement operation on counter c. It shows clock valuations before entering the module and after exiting
the module when simulation is correct. Let t be the amount of time spent in location l0 during simulation.
Let (x, y, z, w) = (1 − 21c , 1 − 21d , 0, 0) be the configuration on entering l0 . We want to ensure that the time

location l1 . This gives us the configuration 0, 1 − 2d , 0, 1 − 2c−1 on reaching l2 . Note that the self loop on
y at location l1 helps in regaining the value of y to be 1 − 21d in the case when d > c. Note that the cost
1
is 0 iff t = 2c−1
. Thus, only correct simulation incurs zero price. Likewise increment module in figure 2
correctly works when t = 1−x
2 .
Observe that after every increment or decrement operation, the value of clock x moves to clock w.
Hence, in order to composing A from individual modules we need to swap the roles of clocks x and w in
every alternate modules. Let hc1 , d1 i be initial configuration and hc2 , d2 i be target configuration of M .
They map to clock valuation ν1 = (enc(c1 ), enc(d1 ), 0, 0) and ν2 = (enc(c2 ), enc(d2 ), 0, 0) respectively.
To make ν1 and ν2 separate locations, we can scale all constants ν1 , ν2 and A so as to make clock values
in ν1 and ν2 integers. The construction is now complete.

4.1 Proof of Theorem 2.2
Lemma 4.3 For every piecewise linearly priced timed automaton (PwLPTA), there exists linearly priced
timed automaton with price preserving strong bisimulation between them.
Proof We prove this lemma by constructing LPTA explicitly from a given PwLPTA. Rest of this section
explains construction and lemma 4.4 proves its correctness.
Construction of LPTA Let A = (LA , XA , EA , IA , πA , ψA ) be a PwLPTA. We construct LPTA B =
(LB , XB , EB , IB , πB , ψB ) from PwLPTA A as follows:
• Let ℓ ∈ LA be some location of A . Delay price function for location ℓ, πA (ℓ, τ ) = fℓ (τ ), is
piecewise linear with respect to τ . fℓ is given by integer restricted structure (Pℓ ,YPℓ ,YIℓ ), where
– Pℓ = hp1 = 0, p2 , . . . , pn i
– YPℓ = hy p1 , y p2 , . . . , y pn i
– YIℓ = h(m1 , c1 ), (m2 , c2 ), . . . , (mn , cn )i with the following interval sequence
def

def

I = hI1 = (p1 , p2 ), I2 = (p2 , p3 ), · · · , In = (pn , pn+1 = +∞)i.
We associate each pi ∈ Pℓ and each I j ∈ I with locations of LB . This association is captured by
mapping α ℓ such that α ℓ (pi ) = ℓ pi and α ℓ (I j ) = ℓ(p j , p j+1 ) . Here, ℓ pi and ℓ(p j , p j+1 ) are the names
of locations of B. We define another mapping β ℓ (I j ) which returns jth entry in the sequence
YIℓ . This mapping is useful for retrieving parameters of delay cost function in the interval I j .
Let θ ℓ = ∪ni=1 {ℓ pi , ℓ(pi , pi+1 ) }. θ ℓ denotes locations in LB generated from location ℓ ∈ LA . Then
LB := ∪ℓ∈LA θ ℓ .
• We add one extra clock named x to B. Thus, XB := XA ∪ {x}. This clock measures time spent at
every location of A . Whenever a run enters any location of A , x is reset to zero.

Let ℓ and m be locations of A and B respectively. We define following relation between ℓ and m,
ϒ = {(ℓ, m) | m ∈ θ ℓ }.
Lemma 4.4 ϒ is price preserving timed bisimilarity.
Proof Let A = (LA , XA , EA , IA , πA , ψA ) be a PwLPTA and B = (LB , XB , EB , IB , πB , ψB ) be
LPTA constructed from A using above construction.
If part: Let t be delay and λ be set of clocks to be reset in A . Now consider following transition
(t,λ )

in TA , (l1 , ν1 , u1 ) −−→ (l1′ , ν1′ , u′1 ). Now we try to find simulating transition in B under relation ϒ. We
(t,λ )

claim its (l2 , ν1 : 0, u1 ) −−→ (l2′ , ν1′ : 0, u′1 ). To hold this claim, we choose l2 ∈ LB such that delay t
matches with expected interval of l2 . If t = pi for some i then l2 = α l1 (pi ). Otherwise t will match with
some interval I j . So l2 = α l1 (I j ). Thus, (l1 , l2 ) ∈ ϒ holds. To place edge in B, construction mandates
(l1′ , l2′ ) ∈ ϒ. Also the clocks in XA change identically. Now, let’s verify that prices are preserved. For
the case where t = pi , (u′1 − u1 ) = y pi + ψA ((l1 , l2 )). Verify that from construction yields same price
difference. For the case where t = I j , location price matters. Verify that rates at l1′ and l2′ are the same in
the construction. Price change (u′1 − u1 ) = m j · t + c j + ψA ((l1 , l2 )). Price offset c j is added to edge cost
in the construction. Thus prices are preserved.
(t,λ )

Else if part: We consider following transition in TB , (l2 , ν2 : 0, u2 ) −−→ (l2′ , ν2′ : 0, u′2 ). We simulate
(t,λ )

it on A to get (l1 , ν2 , u1 ) −−→ (l1′ , ν2′ , u′1 ). If (l1 , l2 ) ∈ ϒ, then construction offers no choice but to choose
l1′ such that (l1′ , l2′ ) ∈ ϒ holds. ν2′ := (ν2 + t)[λ := 0] follows from construction. Verify that prices are
preserved using the same argument as in if part of the proof.
Now we are in position to sketch the proof of Theorem 2.2.
Proof of Theorem 2.2 PSPACE-hardness follows from the fact that LPTA are nothing but PwLPTA
with single piece and their cost-optimal reachability is PSPACE-complete. We now explain a PSPACE
algorithm for solving cost-optimal reachability for PwLPTA. We construct LPTA B for given piecewise linearly priced timed automaton A and solve cost-optimal reachability on B. Construction yields
priced timed bisimilarity ϒ. Using lemma 4.2, we get OptCost(l, l ′ ) = opt {OptCost(m, m′ ) | (l, m) ∈
ϒ and (l ′ , m′ ) ∈ ϒ} where l and l ′ are locations of A , m and m′ are locations of B and opt is either
supremum or infimum.

4.2 Proof of Theorem 2.3
Before we sketch a proof of Theorem 2.3, we introduce the concept of iterative approximation for nonlinear price functions.
Let A = (L, X , E, I, π , ψ ) be a priced timed automaton. If for some location ℓ, price function π (ℓ, τ )
is nonlinear with respect to τ , then A is nonlinearly priced timed automaton (NLPTA).

Definition We define a PwLPTA Au = (L, X , E, I, πu , ψ ) be upper bound price approximation of A , if
for every location ℓ and time τ , πu (ℓ, τ ) ≥ π (ℓ, τ ) and πu (ℓ, τ ) is piecewise linear in τ for a fixed ℓ.
Similarly, a PwLPTA Al = (L, X , E, I, πl , ψ ) is lower bound price approximation of A , if for every
location ℓ and time τ , πl (ℓ, τ ) ≤ π (ℓ, τ ) and πl (ℓ, τ ) is piecewise linear in τ for a fixed ℓ.
Lemma 4.5 OptCostAl (ℓ, ℓ′ ) ≤ OptCostA (ℓ, ℓ′ ) ≤ OptCostAu (ℓ, ℓ′ )
Now we are in position to sketch the proof of Theorem 2.3.
Proof of Theorem 2.3 Let f : R 7→ R be Lipschitz continuous function with Lipschitz constant K. Let
x, y ∈ R be any two arbitrary points in the interval [x, y]. The value of f in [x, y] is upper bounded by
f (x)+ f (y)+K(y−x)
and lower bounded by f (x)+ f (y)−K(y−x)
. Figure 3 shows calculation of these bounds for

a Lipschitz continuous function. More precisely, for every t ∈ [x, y],
f (t) ∈

Assume that f is a rational function. We will first prove decidability of ε -optimal cost reachability
problem using this assumption. Later we will drop this assumption.
We now construct two piecewise linear price functions fl and fu such that fl (t) ≤ f (t) ≤ fu (t) holds
for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . Let T ∈ R+ is a constant such that all clock valuations are bounded above by T .
Let δ ∈ Q+ , 0 < δ ≤ T be the sampling period. Choice for the value of δ is explained at the end of
the proof. We sample f at periodic intervals of δ in the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ T . We define a piecewise linear

Let A be priced timed automaton with Lipschitz continuous price functions at all locations. We construct automata Al and Au by replacing price function at every location while keeping everything else
unchanged. Specifically, if price function at location ℓ in A is π (ℓ) = f , then in Al , price at location

(ℓ)
ℓ is πl = fl . Likewise we assign price πu = fu to location ℓ of Au . Observe that Al and Au are

graph, then sup{kOptCostAl (ℓ, ℓ′ ) − OptCostAu (ℓ, ℓ′ )k} = ε ≤ kDK δ k. This gives us the bound on ε .
We choose δ = kDKk
ε .
In the above construction f is evaluated only at sampling points. We can safely drop the rationality
restriction of f by approximating it by rational function f ′ such that k f − f ′ k ≤ kDK2 δ k .

Step-Bounded Cost-Optimal Reachability Problem

In this section we look into the following step-bounded cost-optimal reachability problem for priced
timed automata.
Step-Bounded Cost-optimal reachability problem Let A be a priced timed automaton. Given two
locations ℓ, ℓ′ of A, step bound N ∈ N, the step-bounded optimal cost OptCostN (ℓ, ℓ′ ), is defined as
OptCostN (ℓ, ℓ′ ) =

inf

ρ ∈RunsN (ℓ,ℓ′ )

C(ρ ),

where RunsN (ℓ, ℓ′ ) are the set of canonical runs between ℓ and ℓ′ of length less than or equal to N.
Given priced timed automaton A , locations ℓ, ℓ′ , and a budget B ∈ R+ the step-bounded cost-optimal
reachability problem is to decide whether OptCostN (ℓ, ℓ′ ) ≤ B.
In this section we extend the encoding of Audemard, Cimatti, Kornilowicz, and Sebastiani [5] to solve
step-bounded optimal-cost reachability problem for priced timed automata. After generating the encoding, we can feed it to SMT solver that support the theory corresponding to the price functions to solve
the step-bounded cost-optimal reachability problem.

5.1 Audemard-Cimatti-Kornilowicz-Sebastiani Encoding for PTA
Let A1 , A2 , . . . An be the priced timed automata which are composed into network of automata A . These
automata communicate using channels. Let η be the set of channels used in A . If c is a channel, then c!
is send operation on the channel c and c? is the blocking receive operation on the channel c.
Original Encoding for Timed Automata. We generate SMT formula for each automata using encoding
from Audemard et. al. [5]. As per their scheme, we create one real variable for every clock and create
separate one for an extra variable named z, which keeps the track of global time. We add a variable
named s of type bitvector at every step which denotes current location. Notation sℓ denotes assertion that
current location is ℓ. We also create two binary variables for each channel per automaton – one for send
and one for receive. For example, if automaton A2 sends over channel c in current step, we set variable
named A2 .c!. This notation helps us to identify automaton which uses that channel in the current step
and the type (send or receive) of an operation performed on that channel. We permit to use global clocks.
While generating formula for A, it may happen that some of the automata share clock names or location
names. For example, automata A1 and A2 may both have local clocks named y. But we must distinguish
between variables that were created to hold value of y in A1 and value of y in A2 . We qualify all variables
with name of automaton they are the part of. Here, we create real variables named A1 .y and A2 .y. All
of these variables are created for every step of a run in a standard bounded-model-checking fashion.
Assertions in Fig. 5.1 describe encoding at current and next step in the formula. We represent next step
variables in primed version. For further details refer to [5].
Extension for Priced Timed Automata. Let A = (L, X , E, I, π , ψ ) be priced timed automaton. To keep
our encoding as general as possible, we describe our SMT formula generation for general priced timed
automata. Observe that this class of automata subsume LPTA, concavely-priced PTA, piecewise-linear

PTA, and Lipschitz-continuous priced PTA. For each automaton, we represent current accumulated price
using real variable named price. We introduce variables pricek at each step. Initially price0 is set to zero
as in 5. When switch transition occurs, we update the price using equation 6. The function ψ (T ) denotes
edge price for the transition T . Equation 7 is used to specify prices for each delay transition. Quantity
(z − z′ ) is the delay incurred at current step and x is vector of current clock valuations. As price functions
are location dependent, we add clause sℓ to check whether current location is ℓ and then update price
accordingly. For null transitions, prices at current and previous step are identical. To decide whether
accumulated price at step n satisfies the condition price(n) ⋊
⋉ k, where ⋊
⋉ ∈ {<, ≤, >, ≥, =, 6=}, we add
an assertion as per Eq. 9.

5.2 Experimental Results
We implemented the encoding discussed in the previous subsection as a vtool [1] for analyzing stepbounded optimal-cost for PTA. Out tool invokes state-of-the-art theorem prover Z3 [11] from Microsoft
Research. It supports linear and non-linear arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, data-types, and quantifiers. For
our purpose, Z3 can be used to solve price functions that are given as a polynomial of time-delay and the
current valuation. Other non-linear price functions such as log, sin, cos, and exp can be accommodated
in this framework using corresponding Taylor series approximations.
In order to show experimental results, we concentrate the standard Airport Landing Scheduling Problem (ALP) from [7]. In order to give comparison with an existing tool we keep the price function linear
and compare our tool with state-of-the-art optimal-cost reachability tool Uppaal-Cora [2].
Airport Landing Scheduling Problem. Given number of airplanes each with attributes like type of
airplane, landing time window and number of runways, assign a landing time and runways to each
airplane such that all airplanes land within their specific landing time window and also comply with
safety regulations like mandatory wake turbulence separation delay. There are two possible sources of
costs. If airplane travels faster than its designated speed, it lands earlier but consumes more fuel. If
airplane landing is delayed, it suffers fuel costs for circling over the airport.

ALP is known to suffer exponential blowup with increasing runways [7]. We used the instances
of ALP problem which are distributed with Uppaal CORA demo version. We asked whether there is
a schedule such that all airplanes land and total cost is bounded from above by a fixed budget (800).
Table 1 shows the results of our experiments. We ran all our experiments on 64-bit IntelR XeonR CPU
E5-2660 v2 running at 2.20GHz with 64 GB RAM. We fixed time limit to 30 minutes for each problem
and used single threaded Z3 SMT solver (v 4.3.2).

Conclusion and Future Work

We studied priced timed automata with non-linear prices and showed the undecidability of a general class
of polynomially-priced timed automata. We then introduced piecewise-linear and Lipschitz-continuous
price functions, and recovered decidability in this restricted setting. We also studied step-bounded costoptimal reachability problem for price timed automata, and implemented an SMT based tool to solve
this problem. This problem is of interest since the optimal-cost reachability problem in some cases (under structurally non-Zeno restriction on timed automata along with non-negativity restriction on prices)
reduces to step-bounded reachability problem.
Observe that, although our tool does not perform as well as random-optimal option of UPPAALCora, it outperforms both dfs and bfs (not reported here). As a future work, we plan to exploit randomization to scale the performance of our implementation. We believe that these experiments presented
here demonstrate the applicability of SMT-based step-bounded verification methodology for mediumsized examples of priced timed automata.
