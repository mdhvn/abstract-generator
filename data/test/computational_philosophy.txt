Alan Turing’s Legacy:
Info-Computational Philosophy of Nature
Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic1
Abstract. Alan Turing’s pioneering work on computability, and
his ideas on morphological computing support Andrew Hodges’
view of Turing as a natural philosopher. Turing’s natural
philosophy differs importantly from Galileo’s view that the book
of nature is written in the language of mathematics (The
Assayer, 1623). Computing is more than a language of nature as
computation produces real time physical behaviors. This article
presents the framework of Natural Info-computationalism as a
contemporary natural philosophy that builds on the legacy of
Turing’s computationalism. Info-computationalism is a synthesis
of Informational Structural Realism (the view that nature is a
web of informational structures) and Natural Computationalism
(the view that nature physically computes its own time
development). It presents a framework for the development of a
unified approach to nature, with common interpretation of
inanimate nature as well as living organisms and their social
networks. Computing is understood as information processing
that drives all the changes on different levels of organization of
information and can be modeled as morphological computing on
data sets pertinent to informational structures. The use of infocomputational conceptualizations, models and tools makes
possible for the first time in history the study of complex selforganizing adaptive systems, including basic characteristics and
functions of living systems, intelligence, and cognition.

1 Turing and Natural Philosophy1
Andrew Hodges [1] describes Turing as a Natural philosopher:
“He thought and lived a generation ahead of his time, and yet the
features of his thought that burst the boundaries of the 1940s are
better described by the antique words: natural philosophy.”
Turing’s natural philosophy differs from Galileo’s view that the
book of nature is written in the language of mathematics (The
Assayer, 1623). Computation is not just a language of nature; it
is the way nature behaves. Computing differs from mathematics
in that computers not only calculate numbers, but more
importantly they can produce real time physical behaviours.
Turing studied a variety of natural phenomena and proposed
their computational modeling. He made a pioneering
contribution in the elucidation of connections between
computation and intelligence and his work on morphogenesis
provides evidence for natural philosophers’ approach. Turing’s
1952 paper on morphogenesis [2] proposed a chemical model as
the basis of the development of biological patterns such as the
spots and stripes that appear on animal skin.

Turing did not originally claim that the physical system
producing patterns actually performs computation through
morphogenesis. Nevertheless, from the perspective of infocomputationalism, [3,4] argues that morphogenesis is a process
of morphological computing. Physical process, though not
computational in the traditional sense, presents natural
(unconventional), physical, morphological computation.
An essential element in this process is the interplay between the
informational structure and the computational process –
information self-structuring. The process of computation
implements physical laws which act on informational structures.
Through the process of computation, structures change their
forms, [5]. All computation on some level of abstraction is
morphological computation – a form-changing/form-generating
process, [4].
In this article, info-computationalism is identified as a new
philosophy of nature providing the basis for the unification of
knowledge from currently disparate fields of natural sciences,
philosophy, and computing. An on-going development in
bioinformatics, computational biology, neuroscience, cognitive
science and related fields shows that in practice biological
systems are currently already studied as information processing
and are modelled using computation-theoretical tools [6,7,8].
Denning declares: “Computing is a natural science” [9] and infocomputationalism provides plenty of support for this claim.
Contemporary biologists such as Kurakin [10] also add to this
information-based naturalism, claiming that “living matter as a
whole represents a multiscale structure-process of energy/matter
flow/circulation, which obeys the empirical laws of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics and which evolves as a selfsimilar structure (fractal) due to the pressures of competition and
evolutionary selection”. [11, p5]

2 Universe as Informational Structure
The universe is, from the metaphysical point of view, "nothing
but processes in structural patterns all the way down" [12, p228].
Understanding patterns as information, one may infer that
information is a fundamental ontological category. The ontology
is scale-relative. What we know about the universe is what we
get from sciences, as "special sciences track real patterns" [12,
p242]. This idea of an informational universe coincides with
Floridi’s Informational Structural Realism [13,14]. We know as
much of the world as we explore and cognitively process:
“Reality in itself is not a source but a resource for knowledge.
Structural objects (clusters of data as relational entities) work
epistemologically like constraining affordances: they allow or
invite certain constructs (they are affordances for the

information system that elaborates them) and resist or impede
some others (they are constraints for the same system),
depending on the interaction with, and the nature of, the
information system that processes them.” [13, p370].
Wolfram [15] finds equivalence between the two descriptions –
matter and information:
“[M]atter is merely our way of representing to ourselves things
that are in fact some pattern of information, but we can also say
that matter is the primary thing and that information is our
representation of that. It makes little difference, I don’t think
there’s a big distinction – if one is right that there’s an ultimate
model for the representation of universe in terms of
computation.” [16, p389].
More detailed discussion of different questions of the
informational universe, natural info-computationalism including
cognition, meaning and intelligent agency is given by Dodig
Crnkovic and Hofkirchner in [17].

3 The Computing Universe – Naturalist
Computationalism
Zuse was the first to suggest (in 1967) that the physical behavior
of the entire universe is being computed on a basic level,
possibly on cellular automata, by the universe itself, which he
referred to as "Rechnender Raum" or Computing Space/Cosmos.
Consequently, Zuse was the first pancomputationalist (natural
computationalist), [18]. Chaitin in [19, p.13] claims that the
universe can be considered to be a computer “constantly
computing its future state from its current state, constantly
computing its own time-evolution account!” He quotes Toffoli,
pointing out that “actual computers like your PC just hitch a ride
on this universal computation!”
Wolfram too advocates for a pancomputationalist view [15], a
new dynamic kind of reductionism in which the complexity of
behaviors and structures found in nature are derived (generated)
from a few basic mechanisms. Natural phenomena are thus the
products of computation processes. In a computational universe
new and unpredictable phenomena emerge as a result of simple
algorithms operating on simple computing elements such as
cellular automata, and complexity originates from the bottom-up
emergent processes. Cellular automata are equivalent to a
universal Turing Machine. Wolfram’s critics remark, however,
that cellular automata do not evolve beyond a certain level of
complexity; the mechanisms involved do not produce
evolutionary development. Wolfram meets this criticism by
pointing out that cellular automata are models and as such
surprisingly successful ones. Also Fredkin [20] in his Digital
philosophy builds on cellular automata, suggesting that particle
physics can emerge from cellular automata. For Fredkin, humans
are software running on a universal computer.
Wolfram and Fredkin, in the tradition of Zuse, assume that the
universe is, on a fundamental level, a discrete system, and is thus
suitably modelled as an all-encompassing digital computer.
However, the computing universe hypothesis (natural
computationalism) does not critically depend on the discreteness
of the physical world, as there are digital as well as analog
computers. On a quantum-mechanical level, the universe
performs computation on characteristically dual wave-particle

objects [21], i.e. both continuous and discrete computing. Maley
[22] demonstrates that it is necessary to distinguish between
analog and continuous, and between digital and discrete
representations. Even though typical examples of analog
representations use continuous media, this is not what makes
them analog. Rather, it is the relationship that they maintain with
what they represent. Similar holds for digital representations.
The lack of proper distinctions in this respect is a source of much
confusion on discrete vs. continuous computational models.
Moreover, even if in some representations it may be discrete
(and thus conform to the Pythagorean ideal of number as a
principle of the world), computation in the universe is performed
at many different levels of organization, including quantum
computing, bio-computing, spatial computing, etc. – some of
them discrete, others continuous. So computing nature seems to
have a use for both discrete and continuous computation, [23].

4 Information Processing Model of Computation
Computation is nowadays performed by computer systems
connected in global networks of multitasking, interacting
devices. The classical understanding of computation as syntactic
mechanical symbol manipulation performed by an isolated
computer is being replaced by the information processing view
by Burgin, [24]. Info-computationalism adopts Burgin definition
of computation as information processing.
In what follows, I will focus on explaining this new idea of
computation, which is essentially different from the notion of
context-free execution of a given procedure in a deterministic
mechanical way. Abramsky summarizes this changing paradigm
of computing as follows:
“Traditionally, the dynamics of computing systems, their
unfolding behaviour in space and time has been a mere means to
the end of computing the function which specifies the algorithmic
problem which the system is solving. In much of contemporary
computing, the situation is reversed: the purpose of the
computing system is to exhibit certain behaviour. (…)
We need a theory of the dynamics of informatic processes, of
interaction, and information flow, as a basis for answering such
fundamental questions as: What is computed? What is a
process? What are the analogues to Turing completeness and
universality when we are concerned with processes and their
behaviours, rather than the functions which they compute?”
[25, p483]
According to Abramsky, there is a need for second generation
models of computation, and in particular there is a need for
process models such as Petri nets, Process Algebra, and similar.
The first generation models of computation originated from
problems of formalization of mathematics and logic, while
processes or agents, interaction, and information flow are
genuine products of the development of computers and
Computer Science. In the second generation models of
computation, previous isolated systems with limited interactions
with the environment are replaced by processes or agents for
which interactions with each other and with the environment are
fundamental.

As a result of interactions among agents and with the
environment, complex behaviour emerges. The basic building
block of this interactive approach is the agent, and the
fundamental operation is interaction. The ideal is the
computational behaviour of an organism, not mechanical
machinery. This approach works at both the macro-scale (such
as processes in operating systems, software agents on the
Internet, transactions, etc.) and on the micro-scale (from program
implementation, down to hardware).
The above view of the relationship between information and
computation presented in [25] agrees with ideas of infocomputational naturalism of Dodig-Crnkovic [3] which are
based on the same understanding of computation and its relation
to information. Implementation of info-computationalism,
interactive computing (such as, among others, agent-based)
naturally suits the purpose of modelling a network of mutually
communicating processes/agents, see [3,4,5].

environments by self-organization, self-configuration, selfoptimization, self-healing, self-protection and contextawareness. In many areas, we have to computationally model
emergence which is not algorithmic according to Cooper [26]
and Cooper and Sloman [27]. This makes the investigation of
computational characteristics of non-algorithmic natural
computation (sub-symbolic, analog) particularly interesting.
In sum, solutions are being sought in natural systems with
evolutionary developed strategies for handling complexity in
order to improve complex networks of massively parallel
autonomous engineered computational systems. Research in
theoretical foundations of Natural computing is needed to
improve understanding of the fundamental level of computation
as information processing which underlies all computing.

6 Information as a Fabric of Reality
“Information is the difference that makes a difference. “ [29]

5 Natural Computation
Natural computing is a new paradigm of computing which deals
with computability in the natural world. It has brought a new
understanding of computation and presents a promising new
approach to the complex world of autonomous, intelligent,
adaptive, and networked computing that has emerged
successively in recent years. Significant for Natural computing is
a bidirectional research [7]: as natural sciences are rapidly
absorbing ideas of information processing, computing is
concurrently assimilating ideas from natural sciences.
The classical mathematical theory of computation was devised
long before global computer networks. Ideal, classical theoretical
computers are mathematical objects and they are equivalent to
algorithms, Turing machines, effective procedures, recursive
functions or formal languages. Compared with new computing
paradigms, Turing machines form the proper subset of the set of
information processing devices, in much the same way as
Newton’s theory of gravitation presents a special case of
Einstein’s theory, or Euclidean geometry presents a limited case
of non-Euclidean geometries, [5].
Natural/Unconventional computing as a study of computational
systems includes computing techniques that take inspiration
from nature, use computers to simulate natural phenomena or
compute with natural materials (such as molecules, atoms or
DNA). Natural computation is well suited for dealing with large,
complex, and dynamic problems. It is an emerging
interdisciplinary area closely related to artificial intelligence and
cognitive science, vision and image processing, neuroscience,
systems biology and bioinformatics, to mention but a few.
Computational paradigms studied by natural computing are
abstracted from natural phenomena such as self-* attributes of
living (organic) systems (including -replication, -repair, definition and -assembly), the functioning of the brain,
evolution, the immune systems, cell membranes, and
morphogenesis.
Unlike in the Turing model, where the Halting problem is
central, the main issue in Natural computing is the adequacy of
the computational response (behaviour). The organic computing
system adapts dynamically to the current conditions of its

More specifically, Bateson’s difference is the difference in the
world that makes the difference for an agent. Here the world also
includes agents themselves. As an example, take the visual field
of a microscope/telescope: A difference that makes a difference
for an agent who can see (visible) light appears when she/he/it
detects an object in the visual field. What is observed presents a
difference that makes the difference for that agent. For another
agent who may see only ultra-violet radiation, the visible part of
the spectrum might not bring any difference at all. So the
difference that makes a difference for an agent depends on what
the agent is able to detect or perceive. Nowadays, with the help
of scientific instruments, we see much more than ever before,
which is yet further enhanced by visualization techniques that
can graphically represent any kind of data.
A system of differences that make a difference (information
structures that build information architecture), observed and
memorized, represents the fabric of reality for an agent.
Informational Structural Realism [13] [30] argues exactly that:
information is the fabric of reality. Reality consists of
informational structures organized on different levels of
abstraction/resolution. A similar view is defended in [12]. Dodig
Crnkovic [3] identifies this fabric of reality (Kantian 'Ding an
sich') as potential information and makes the distinction between
it and actual information for an agent. Potential information for
an agent is all that exists as not yet actualized for an agent, and it
becomes information through interactions with an agent for
whom it makes a difference.
Informational structures of the world constantly change on all
levels of organization, so the knowledge of structures is only half
the story. The other half is the knowledge of processes –
information dynamics.
It is important to note the difference between the potential
information (world in itself) and actual information (world for an
agent). Meaningful information, which is what in everyday
speech is meant by information, is the result of interaction
between an agent and the world. Meaning is use, and for an
agent information has meaning when it has certain use. Menant
[31] proposes to analyze relations between information, meaning
and representation through an evolutionary approach.

7 Info-Computationalism as Natural Philosophy
Info-computationalist naturalism identifies computational
process with the dynamic interaction of informational structures.
It includes digital and analog, continuous and discrete, as
phenomena existing in the physical world on different levels of
organization. Our present-day digital computing is a subset of a
more general Natural computing. In this framework,
computational processes are understood as natural computation,
since information processing (computation) is not only found in
human communication and computational machinery but also in
the entirety of nature.
Information represents the world (reality as an informational
web) for a cognizing agent, while information dynamics
(information processing, computation) implements physical laws
through which all the changes of informational structures unfold.
Computation, as it appears in the natural world, is more general
than the human process of calculation modelled by the Turing
machine. Natural computing takes place through the interactions
of concurrent asynchronous computational processes, which are
the most general representation of information dynamics [5].

8 Conclusions
Alan Turing’s work on computing machinery, which provided
the basis for artificial intelligence and the study of its
relationship to natural intelligence, together with his
computational models of morphogenesis, can be seen as a
pioneering contribution to the field of Natural Computing and
the Computational Philosophy of Nature. Today’s infocomputationalism builds on the tradition of Turing’s
computational Natural Philosophy. It is a kind of epistemological
naturalism based on the synthesis of two fundamental
cosmological ideas: the universe as informational structure
(informationalism) and the universe as a network of
computational
processes
(pancomputationalism/naturalist
computationalism).
Information and computation in this framework are two
complementary concepts representing structure and process,
being and becoming. Info-computational conceptualizations,
models and tools enable the study of nature and its complex,
dynamic structures, and uncover unprecedented new possibilities
in the understanding of the connections between earlier unrelated
phenomena of non-living and living nature [28].
