* Accept a paper as a file from the user. 
	- Worry about formats later. For now, just store the content of a paper in a text file. 
          We can later  modify this to work with other formats (.tex, .pdf, .docx, etc.).

* Get data from the text
	- For now, we may assume that the text has clearly defined sections, i.e. the Introduction,
          Past Work, Methods, etc. sections are all marked with headers. Our program should(?) later
          be modified to not need to rely on these section headers. 

        - Compute the tf-idf for every word:
          	1) within the section it occurs in
		2) within the entire document(?)

        - Words with the highest tf-idfs(?) can (to some degree(?)) be determined important to the 
          document. These are our keywords.
